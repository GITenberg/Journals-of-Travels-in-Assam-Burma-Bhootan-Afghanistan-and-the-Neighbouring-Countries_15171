<h2>NOTICE OF WILLIAM GRIFFITH, from the Proceedings of the Linn&aelig;an
Society, with a few extracts from his private correspondence.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;WILLIAM GRIFFITH, Esq., the youngest son of the late Thomas
Griffith, was born on the 4th of March 1810, at his father&rsquo;s residence
at Ham Common, near Kingston-upon-Thames, in the county of Surrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was educated for the Medical profession, and completed
his studies at the London University, where he became a pupil of Prof.
Lindley, under whose able instructions, assisted by the zealous friendship
of Mr. R. H. Solly, and in conjunction with two fellow pupils of great
scientific promise, Mr. Slack and Mr. Valentine, he made rapid progress
in the acquisition of botanical knowledge.&nbsp; The first public proofs
that he gave of his abilities are contained in a microscopic delineation
of the structure of the wood and an analysis of the flower of <i>Phytocrene</i>
<i>gigantea</i>, in the third volume of Dr. Wallich&rsquo;s &lsquo;Plant&aelig;
Asiatic&aelig; Rariores&rsquo;; and in a note on the development and
structure of <i>Targionia</i> <i>hypophylla</i>, appended to M. de Mirbel&rsquo;s
Dissertation on <i>Marchantia</i> <i>polymorpha</i>, both published
in 1832.&nbsp; So highly were his talents as an observer appreciated
at this early period, that Dr. Wallich speaks of him as one &ldquo;whose
extraordinary talents and knowledge as a botanist, entitle him to the
respect of all lovers of the science;&rdquo; and M. de Mirbel characterizes
him as &ldquo;jeune Anglois, tr&egrave;s instruit, tr&egrave;s z&eacute;l&eacute;
et fort bon observateur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His note on <i>Targionia</i> is dated Paris, April 2nd, 1832,
and in the month of May of the same year, having finished his studies
at the London University with great distinction, he sailed from England
for India, which was destined to be the scene of his future labours.&nbsp;
He arrived at Madras on the 24th of September, and immediately received
his appointment as Assistant-Surgeon in the service of the East India
Company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His first appointment in India was to the coast of Tenasserim;
but in the year 1835 he was attached to the Bengal Presidency, and was
selected to form one of a deputation, consisting of Dr. Wallich and
himself as botanists, and Mr. MacClelland as geologist, to visit and
inspect the Tea-forests (as they were called) of Assam, and to make
researches in the natural history of that almost unexplored district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mission was for Mr. Griffith the commencement of a series
of journeys in pursuit of botanical knowledge, embracing nearly the
whole extent of the East India Company&rsquo;s extra-peninsular possessions,
and adding large collections, in every branch of natural history, but
especially botany, to those which, under the auspices of the Indian
Government, had previously been formed.&nbsp; He next, under the directions
of Capt. Jenkins, the Commissioner, pushed his investigations to the
utmost eastern limit of the Company&rsquo;s territory, traversing the
hitherto unexplored tracts in the neighbourhood of the Mishmee mountains
which lie between Suddiya and Ava.&nbsp; Of the splendid collection
of insects formed during this part of his tour some account has been
given by Mr. Hope in the Transactions of the Entomological Society and
in the eighteenth volume of our own Transactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His collection of plants was also largely increased on this
remarkable journey, which was followed by a still more perilous expedition,
commenced in February of the following year, from Assam through the
Burmese dominions to Ava, and down the Irrawadi to Rangoon, in the course
of which he was reported to have been assassinated.&nbsp; The hardships
through which he passed during the journey and his excessive application
produced, soon after his arrival in Calcutta, a severe attack of fever:
on his recovery from which he was appointed Surgeon to the Embassy to
Bootan, then about to depart under the charge of the late Major Pemberton.&nbsp;
He took this opportunity of revisiting the Khasiya Hills, among which
he formed a most extensive collection; and having joined Major Pemberton
at Goalpara, traversed with him above 400 miles of the Bootan country,
from which he returned to Calcutta about the end of June 1839.&nbsp;
In November of the same year he joined the army of the Indus in a scientific
capacity, and penetrated, after the subjugation of Cabool, beyond the
Hindoo Khoosh into Khorassan, from whence, as well as from Affghanistan,
he brought collections of great value and extent.&nbsp; During these
arduous journeys his health had several times suffered most severely,
and he was more than once reduced by fever to a state of extreme exhaustion;
but up to this time the strength of his constitution enabled him to
triumph over the attacks of disease, and the energy of his mind was
so great, that the first days of convalescence found him again as actively
employed as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On his return to Calcutta in August 1841, after visiting Simla
and the Nerbudda, he was appointed to the medical duties at Malacca:
but Dr. Wallich having proceeded to the Cape for the re-establishment
of his health, Mr. Griffith was recalled in August 1842 to take, during
his absence, the superintendence of the Botanic Garden near Calcutta,
in conjunction with which he also discharged the duties of Botanical
Professor in the Medical College to the great advantage of the students.&nbsp;
Towards the end of 1844 Dr. Wallich resumed his functions at the Botanic
Garden.&nbsp; In September Mr. Griffith married Miss Henderson, the
sister of the wife of his brother, Captain Griffith, and on the 11th
of December he quitted Calcutta to return to Malacca, where he arrived
on the 9th of January in the present year.&nbsp; On the 31st of the
same month he was attacked by hepatitis, and notwithstanding every attention
on the part of the medical officer who had officiated during his absence,
and who fortunately still remained, he gradually sunk under the attack,
which terminated fatally on the 9th of February.&nbsp; &ldquo;His constitution,&rdquo;
says his attached friend, Mr. MacClelland, in a letter to Dr. Horsfield,
&ldquo;seemed for the last two or three years greatly shattered, his
energies alone remaining unchanged.&nbsp; Exposure during his former
journeys and travels laid the seeds of his fatal malady in his constitution,
while his anxiety about his pursuits and his zeal increased.&nbsp; He
became care-worn and haggard in his looks, often complaining of anomalous
symptoms, marked by an extreme rapidity of pulse, in consequence of
which he had left off wine for some years past, and was obliged to observe
great care and attention in his diet.&nbsp; In Affghanistan he was very
nearly carried off by fever, to which he had been subject in his former
travels in Assam.&nbsp; No government ever had a more devoted or zealous
servant, and I impute much of the evil consequences to his health to
his attempting more than the means at his disposal enabled him to accomplish
with justice to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most important of Mr. Griffith&rsquo;s published memoirs
are contained in the Transactions of the Linn&aelig;an Society.&nbsp;
Previous to starting on his mission to Assam, he communicated to the
Society the first two of a series of valuable papers on the development
of the vegetable ovulum in <i>Santalum</i>, <i>Loranthus</i>, <i>Viscum</i>,
and some other plants, the anomalous structure of which appeared calculated
to throw light on this still obscure and difficult subject.&nbsp; These
papers are entitled as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; On the Ovulum of <i>Santalum</i> <i>album</i>.&nbsp; Linn.
Trans. xviii.&nbsp; p. 57.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Notes on the Development of the Ovulum of <i>Loranthus</i>
and <i>Viscum</i>; and on the mode of Parasitism of these two genera.&nbsp;
Linn. Trans. xviii. p. 71.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; On the Ovulum of <i>Santalum</i>, <i>Osyris</i>, <i>Loranthus</i>
and <i>Viscum</i>.&nbsp; Linn. Trans. xix. p. 171.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another memoir, or rather series of memoirs, &ldquo;On the
Root-Parasites, referred by authors to <i>Rhizanthe&aelig;</i>, and
on various plants related to them,&rdquo; occupies the first place in
the Part of our Transactions which is now in the press, with the exception
of the portion relating to <i>Balanophore&aelig;</i>, unavoidably deferred
to the next following Part.&nbsp; In this memoir, as in those which
preceded it, Mr. Griffith deals with some of the most obscure and difficult
questions of vegetable physiology, on which his minute and elaborate
researches into the singularly anomalous structure of the curious plants
referred to will be found to have thrown much new and valuable light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In India, on his return from his Assamese journey, he published
in the &lsquo;Transactions of the Agricultural Society of Calcutta,&rsquo;
a &lsquo;Report on the Tea-plant of Upper Assam,&rsquo; which, although
for reasons stated avowedly incomplete, contains a large amount of useful
information on a subject which was then considered of great practical
importance.&nbsp; He also published in the &lsquo;Asiatic Researches,&rsquo;
in the &lsquo;Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,&rsquo; and in
the &lsquo;Transactions of the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta,&rsquo;
numerous valuable botanical papers; but the most important of his Indian
publications are contained in the &lsquo;Calcutta Journal of Natural
History,&rsquo; edited jointly by Mr. MacClelland and himself.&nbsp;
Of these it may be sufficient at present to refer to his memoir &ldquo;On
<i>Azolla</i> and <i>Salvinia</i>,&rdquo; two very remarkable plants
which he has most elaborately illustrated, and in relation to which
he has entered into some very curious speculations; and his still unfinished
monograph of &ldquo;The Palms of British India,&rdquo; which promises
to be a highly important contribution to our knowledge of a group hitherto
almost a sealed book to European Botanists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the great object of his life, that for which all his other
labours were but a preparation, was the publication of a General Scientific
Flora of India, a task of immense extent, labour and importance.&nbsp;
To the acquisition of materials for this task, in the shape of collections,
dissections, drawings and descriptions, made under the most favourable
circumstances, he had devoted twelve years of unremitted exertion.&nbsp;
His own collections, (not including those formed in Cabool and the neighbouring
countries) he estimated at 2500 species from the Khasiya Hills, 2000
from the Tenasserim provinces, 1000 from the province of Assam, 1200
from the Himalaya range in the Mishmee country, 1700 from the same great
range in the country of Bootan, 1000 from the neighbourhood of Calcutta,
and 1200 from the Naga Hills at the extreme east of Upper Assam, from
the valley of Hookhoong, the district of Mogam, and from the tract of
the Irrawadi between Mogam and Ava.&nbsp; Even after making large deductions
from the sum-total of these numbers on account of the forms common to
two or more of the collections, the amount of materials thus brought
together by one man must be regarded as enormous.&nbsp; The time was
approaching when he believed that he could render these vast collections
subservient to the great end which he had in view.&nbsp; He had some
time since issued an invitation to many eminent botanists in Europe
to co-operate with him in the elaboration of particular families; and
he purposed after a few years&rsquo; additional residence in India to
return to England with all his materials, and to occupy himself in giving
to the world the results of his unwearied labours.&nbsp; But this purpose
was not destined to be fulfilled, his collections have passed by his
directions into the hands of the East India Company, and there can be
no doubt, from the well-known liberality of the Directors, which this
Society in particular has so often experienced, that they will be so
disposed of by that enlightened body as to fulfil at once the demands
of science and the last wishes of the faithful and devoted servant by
whom they were formed.&nbsp; It is hoped too, that the most important
of his unpublished materials, both in drawings and manuscripts, will
be given to the world in a manner worthy of the author and of the rank
in science which he filled.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Proceedings</i> <i>of</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Linn&aelig;an</i> <i>Society</i>, No. xxv, 1845.</p>
<p>To the foregoing brief sketch which was read before the Linn&aelig;an
Society at the Anniversary Meeting 24th May 1845, it is scarcely necessary
to make any addition.&nbsp; It is worthy of remark however, as showing
how talents sometimes run in families, that Mr. Griffith was great grandson
of Jeremiah Meyer, Historical Painter to George the Second, and one
of the founders of the Royal Academy.&nbsp; It is also but fair to state
on the present occasion, that he was not himself the only member of
the family who would appear to have inherited something of his grandfather&rsquo;s
peculiar art, as we owe the transfer of the landscapes to stone, which
add so much to the appearance of the following volume, to the talent
and kindness of his sister.</p>
<p>It may perhaps be acceptable in this place to afford a few extracts
from the private letters of Mr. Griffith, especially those in which
he adverts with a liberality of feeling to his contemporaries, no less
honourable to himself than to the persons mentioned.</p>
<p>The following notes addressed to his uncle, at various periods, exhibit
the sentiments with which he regarded the late Mr. Bauer not merely
as an artist, but original observer.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p><i>From</i> <i>letters</i> <i>of</i> <i>Mr</i>. <i>GRIFFITH</i>,
<i>to</i> <i>Mr</i>. <i>MEYER</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mergui</i>:
<i>January</i> <i>17th</i>, 1835.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My last accounts of Mr. Bauer state him to have been in excellent
health: he had just completed some more of his unrivalled drawings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Suddya</i>:
<i>December</i> <i>30th</i>, 1836.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray give the compliments of the season to Mr. Bauer, to whom
I look up with the greatest admiration: what a pity it is for science
that such a life as his is not renewable <i>ad</i> <i>libitum</i>.&nbsp;
Tell him that I have a beautiful new genus allied to Rafflesia, the
flowers of which are about a span across, it is di&oelig;cious and icosandrous,
and has an abominable smell.&nbsp; How I look back occasionally on my
frequent and delightful visits to Kew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>To MRS. H---.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Serampore</i>,
<i>Calcutta</i>: <i>July</i> <i>22nd</i>, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was aware of the departure of Mr. Bauer through the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
in which an excellent notice of him appeared.&nbsp; He certainly was
a man to whom I looked up with constant admiration: he was incomparable
in several respects, and I am happy to find, that his death was so characteristic
of his most inoffensive and meritorious life.&nbsp; It is also very
pleasing to me to find that he continued to think well of me.&nbsp;
How I should have been able to delight him had he lived a few years
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Calcutta</i>:
<i>June</i>, 1843.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. Bauer, we never shall see his like again, I have
seen but few notices of his life, which assuredly is worthy of study.&nbsp;
There is not a place I shall visit with better feelings than Kew, it
has so many pleasant associations even from my school-days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Calcutta</i>:
<i>December</i> <i>31st</i>, 1843.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bauer is not half appreciated yet; he is considered a
very great artist, but what is that to what he was?&nbsp; But he did
not fight for his own hand, though he worked hard enough in all conscience.&nbsp;
Mr. Bauer in fact preceded all in the train of discovery: he saw in
1797, what others did not see till 30 years after.&nbsp; For instance,
the elongation of the pollens&rsquo; inner membrane into a tube, the
first step towards the <i>complete</i> knowledge we now have of vegetable
embryogeny.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Mr. Bauer drew, but did not write,
and when I recall to mind a remark of Mr. Brown, that it was a disadvantage
to be able to draw, I always fancy he had Bauer in his mind&rsquo;s
eye; for had he been a writer and not a drawer, before 1800, in great
probability we should have known nearly as much of embryogeny as we
do now.&nbsp; But he shut his portfolio, and folks went on believing
the old fovivillose doctrine and bursting of the pollen, which, his
observations of the pollens&rsquo; inner membrane, would have destroyed
at once.&nbsp; Then with regard to Orchide&aelig; and Asclepiade&aelig;,
he was equally in advance: it would be a rich treat if some one would
come forward and publish a selection from his drawings, without a word
of letterpress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Calcutta</i>:
<i>February</i> <i>11th</i>, 1844.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bauer&rsquo;s light is not yet set on the hill.&nbsp;
Really when I look back at his works I am lost in admiration, and always
regret that he worked more for others than for himself, and that he
did not use his pen as freely as he did his brush.&nbsp; When, in the
name of all that is generous, will great men think that true greatness
consist in endeavouring to make others more prominent than themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some years before his death, Mr. Griffith would appear to have
had a presentiment that he would not be spared to complete the description
of all his collections.&nbsp; On one occasion, when enumerating those
who might contribute most efficiently to this object, in the event of
its not being permitted to himself, he writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot however refrain from paying my tribute of respect
to Mr. George Bentham, the most industrious, perspicuous, and philosophical
Botanist who has systematically contributed to lessen the difficulties
under which Indian Botanists have generally suffered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a few others from whom the sincerity of friendship
fully warrants me in expecting every possible assistance: of these Dr.
Wight is already well known, and others are rising rapidly to fill,
I hope, the highest Botanical stations when these shall have been vacated
by the leviathans who now occupy them.&nbsp; Let not the cynic accuse
me of partiality when I mention the names of William Valentine, of Decaisne,
and C. M. Lemann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also delighted to speak and write in terms of the warmest regard
of those to whom he was indebted for facilities in his pursuits.&nbsp;
To Lord Auckland he invariably alluded in terms of the deepest gratitude&mdash;&ldquo;Under
his Lordship&rsquo;s patronage&rdquo; he remarks on one occasion, &ldquo;I
have received such advantages as make me ashamed of the little I have
done, and which are constantly holding up before me my deficiencies
in many branches of enquiry connected with the physiology and distribution
of plants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The following letters are quoted chiefly for the additional information
they afford on the subject of his travels and pursuits.&nbsp; His letters
to Botanists would of course be more important and interesting.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Suddyah</i>:
<i>16th</i> <i>September</i>, 1836.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of the cold weather, as
on the 1st of November I hope to accompany ----- to Ava, but in the
meantime, I intend proceeding in search of the tea plant to the Mishmee
Hills, especially about Bramakoond, where it is reported to grow.&nbsp;
If I find it there, I will endeavour to trace it up into the mountains,
which form due east of this an amphitheatre of high rugged peaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>November</i>
<i>1st</i>, 1836.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I here write from the foot of the &lsquo;dreaded&rsquo; Mishmee
Hills.&nbsp; I left Suddyah on the 15th October, and have already been
to Bramakoond, where I spent three days.&nbsp; I miss you much; you
would have been delighted with the place, which is nothing but rocks
and hills.&nbsp; I am recruiting my resources for a movement into the
interior of the hills, in which I shall follow Wilcox&rsquo;s route,
taking with me 15 coolies, for whom I am collecting grain.&nbsp; I have
already made considerable collections, chiefly however in Botany, with
a few stones and birds.&nbsp; I hope before my return to have seen Coptis
teeta in flower, and to have proved that the Beese is different from
that of Nepal.&nbsp; I have already seen numbers of the Mishmees who
are civil people.&nbsp; I have however had great difficulties with the
Chief of the Khond, who though apparently friendly, will, I fear, do
all he can to hinder me from getting to Ghaloom, with the Gham of which
place I wish to have a conference.&rdquo;</p>

<i>Dihing</i> <i>Mookh</i>: <i>January</i> <i>20th</i>, 1837.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just returned from the trip to the Lohit much sooner
than I expected.&nbsp; I saw nothing of any consequence except rapids
which are horrid things, and make one quite nervous.&nbsp; I made a
beautiful collection on the Mishmee mountains, of which more anon.&nbsp;
Many of the plants are very interesting.&nbsp; I was however worked
very hard, all my people being sick: I had even to wash my own clothes,
but I fear you will think I am grumbling: so good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<i>11th</i> <i>December</i>, 1838.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrived here in 14&frac12; days, notwithstanding some delays
on the road, and have put up with Cornet Robinson, Acting Political
Agent.&nbsp; I am not pleased with the up-country, and would rather
live in Bengal, for I cannot abide sandy plains and a deficiency of
vegetation.&nbsp; Loodianah is a curious place, very striking to a stranger,
the town is large, built under official direction, and consequently
well arranged in comparison with native towns: there is much trade carried
on in it, and it has the usual bustle of a large town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capt. Wade&rsquo;s house is well situated on a rising ground,
and the demesne is a pretty one.&nbsp; Otherwise the country is ugly
enough, and very bare, yet it is here well wooded, in comparison with
what I hear of Ferozepore.&nbsp; Along the face of the hill near the
town, a nullah flows, abounding in fish, of which more anon.&nbsp; The
rock pigeons, or grouse, are very abundant, and there are two species,
one remarkable for the elongated side-feathers of the tail.&nbsp; Both
are beautiful birds, but very difficult of access.&nbsp; Crows, kites,
vultures, adjutants, herons, Drongoles, sparrows, parrots, etc. remain
as before, but most of the less common birds are different from those
to the south; the most European are genuine starlings; and, to my memory
of eight years back, identical with those of Europe.&nbsp; I have already
got thirty to forty species of fish.&nbsp; Cyprinid&aelig;, are by far
the most common; one loach, and one of Macrognathus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as they are all from one water, viz. the neighbouring
nullah, and the Sutledge being five miles off, I shall put them all
into bottles, and send them off before I leave this.&nbsp; The most
edible fish, and one of the most common is the Roh, but it is not the
Roh of Bengal, and might well be called Cyprinus ruber.&nbsp; Burnes
has given I think a drawing of it, which is faithful as to colour.&nbsp;
All the forms will be familiar to you, but I hope there will be some
new species.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made further arrangements, and such as will give you
a good insight into the fish of the Sutledge, as to the number of duplicates!&mdash;it
is the safest plan for an ignoramus not to discriminate too nicely.&nbsp;
I am to-day to get large specimens of the Kalabans, Rohi, etc. what
a splendid fish the Rohi is, both to look at and to eat.&nbsp; There
are two or three species of the transparent <i>Chandas</i>, and three
or four Perilamps, six or eight Silurid&aelig;, besides the Gwali, which
is too large; of Ophiocephalus two or three, exclusive of the Sowli,
but all ought to be examined, as there is no relying on native discrimination.&nbsp;
There is a curious animal here burrowing like a mole, but more like
a rat: of this I have not yet got a specimen, although they are very
common.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I commence with a list of the fish of this place.&nbsp; I
have only to mention that several species are confounded under the name
Bhoor, all the Chandras under Chunda Begla, Loaches under Pote, all
the Perilamps except the Chulwa, which may be from its flavour a <i>Clupeia</i>,
etc.&nbsp; The fact is, that the fishermen are aware of genera, but
not of species, excepting when the distinctive marks are very strong.&nbsp;
The fisherman enumerates forty species, but I have only twenty-six,
I have promised him one rupee when he completes the list:</p>

<i>May</i> <i>the</i> <i>2nd</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen three changes in the geological structure of
the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Khojah Omrah was chiefly clay slate, and we are now in
another formation, which no one seems to know; but it must be different
as the outlines of the hills are completely changed.&nbsp; We are now
3,500 feet above the sea.&nbsp; The climate is good, and would be delightful
in a good house, but in tents the thermometer varies from 60&deg; to
98&deg; and even 105&deg;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got a decent collection of plants, only amounting however
to 650 species.&nbsp; The flora continues quite European.&nbsp; I have
some of singular interest.&nbsp; Composit&aelig;, Crucifer&aelig;, and
Gramine&aelig; form the bulk of the vegetation.&nbsp; All fish are very
different from those below the Ghats.&nbsp; I have five or six species
of Cyprinid&aelig;.&nbsp; One very inimitable fuscous loach.&nbsp; There
are few birds, and fewer quadrupeds; in fact the country is at a minimum
in both these respects.&rdquo;</p>

<i>July</i> <i>25th</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been gradually ascending since leaving Candahar, and
are here at an elevation of 7,600 feet.&nbsp; The same features continue.&nbsp;
I have as yet not more than 850 species.&nbsp; The mountains on every
side, and indeed the whole face of the country, is still bare.&nbsp;
Mookloor, a district through which we passed, about seventy miles from
this, is well cultivated and inhabited.&nbsp; There are few birds to
be seen, and scarcely any insects, but there are numerous lizards.&nbsp;
The thermometer varies in tents from 60&deg; to 90&deg;.&rdquo;</p>

<i>August</i> <i>11th</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am encamped close to Baber&rsquo;s tomb, lulled by the sound
of falling water, and cooled with the shade of poplar and sycamore trees,
with abundance of delicious fruit, and altogether quite happy for the
nonce.&nbsp; I have not yet seen the town which is a strange place,
buried in gardens: but nothing can exceed the rich cultivation of the
valley in which we are encamped.&nbsp; Beautiful fields on every side,
with streamlets, rich verdure, poplars, willows, and bold mountain scenery,
which contrasts most favourably with the dreary barren tracts to which
we have been accustomed.&nbsp; I go with the Engineers to Bamean in
the course of a few days, when we shall cross ridges of 12,000 to 13,000
feet high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only find three kinds of fish in this neighbourhood.&nbsp;
I have been making some drawings, and collecting a few plants which
continue to be entirely European.&rdquo;</p>

<i>November</i> <i>17th</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope some day or other to turn out a real traveller.&nbsp;
I am now in hopes of becoming a decent surveyor, and before many years
have passed a decent meteorologist.&nbsp; I leave the Army here, and
shall part with it, particularly Thomson and Durand of the Engineers,
with regret.&nbsp; I start in a short time to travel up the Indus with
little before me but difficulties, however <i>&agrave;</i> <i>la</i>
<i>renomm&eacute;e</i>.&nbsp; If I can do something unparalleled in
the travelling way I shall be content for a year or two at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have obtained some few specimens of fossil shells from the
shingly beds of the Khyber Pass.&nbsp; They seem to be a Spirifer with
a very square base, quite different from the common species of the Bolan
Pass, which is like a large cockle, and of which I have one beautiful
specimen.&nbsp; How I regret not seeing Bukkur, for with a few days&rsquo;
leisure, a number of fossils might be obtained.&nbsp; The older I grow
the less content am I scientifically: would that I had received a mathematical
education.&nbsp; I was much interested with some quotations from Lyell&rsquo;s
Elements in a late <i>Calcutta</i> <i>Courier</i>, especially about
the Marine Saurian from the Gallepagos.&nbsp; What further proof can
be wanted of the maritime and insular nature of the world during the
reigns of the Saurian reptiles?&nbsp; What more conclusive can be expected
about the appearance of new species?&nbsp; This point would at once
be settled if the formation of these islands can be proved not to have
been contemporaneous with the Continents.&nbsp; Then the animal nature
of chalk!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing nothing in botany, but learning Persian, and the
use of the theodolite, with nothing but difficulties to look at all
around.&nbsp; I begin to feel of such importance, (do not think me conceited
in relation to my collections and information on geographical botany,)
that I am not overpleased with the idea of facing dangers alone: however
I suppose every thing is as usual exaggerated.&rdquo;</p>

<i>August</i> <i>3rd</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I crossed the Hindoo-koosh by my former route, and
this morning while out, i.e. trout fishing, was most agreeably interrupted
by the post.&nbsp; The fishing was ended forthwith.&nbsp; Indeed the
sun in this country even at elevations of 12,000 feet is very hot, and
has excoriated my hands, beautifully white as they were after my sickness,
but not before I had caught 3 barbels, evidently different from those
of the other side of the range.&nbsp; I caught some trout yesterday
evening, it is a most beautiful fish, I was particularly struck with
the size of the eye, its prominence, and expressive pupil, in opposition
to the sluggishness of the eyes of carps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange that Botany has always been the most favoured
of the natural sciences, it is strange that in spite of what all do
say it is the least advanced of any.&nbsp; How can I reconcile my own
splendid opportunities with those of more deserving naturalists in other
branches? and I would willingly share them on the principle of common
fairness with others, who I know would turn them to a better account.&nbsp;
Oreinus takes the worm greedily; in the Helmund, 11,000 feet above the
sea, it is abundant.&nbsp; It is the same species I think as that in
the Cabul river; but in the Cabul river, Barbus is the predominant fish:
in the Helmund it is the reverse.&nbsp; How can one account for the
small elevation at which fish are found in the Himalayan?&nbsp; I cannot
imagine it is owing as some think to the relative impetuosity of the
rivers, which after all is only an assumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Bamean valley is the strangest place imaginable, its
barrenness and the variegated colours of the rocks convey the idea of
its volcanic origin, and give it a look as if it had come out of the
furnace.&nbsp; I cannot make out where the stones so universally found
all over the slopes of the mountains, came from, for very generally
they seem water-worn.&nbsp; I find no great peculiarity in the flora
of this side of the range, except an abundance of odd-looking Chenopodiaceous
plants, probably resulting from the saline saturation of the soil.&nbsp;
There is a very singular spring on the other side of the range, about
11,000 feet above the sea: the water very clear, with no remarkable
taste, but every thing around is covered with a deposit of a highly
ferruginous powder.&nbsp; I shall write next from the fossil locality,
which is said to be about forty miles from this.&nbsp; I am as stout
as ever, but by no means so strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am now out of the region of trees, excepting a poplar, of
which I will send you a bit, as the same tree grows in much lower places.&nbsp;
The want of rings in wood is by no means unusual in tropical vegetation.&nbsp;
For the production of rings, some annual check to vegetation is required:
their absence is particularly frequent in climbers.&nbsp; The walnut
will not be a good instance, because even if you can get it from Java,
it is a tree that requires cold, and must consequently be found at considerable
altitudes.&nbsp; Your instances must be taken from subjects that can
bear a great range of climate: you have some in the apricot, vine, etc.&nbsp;
I will not fail in sending you what you want from Cabul, and also from
Peshawur, in which almost the extremes of temperature can be contrasted.&nbsp;
I will also get the woods of apricots, cherries, etc., at the highest
elevations on my road back, as I hope to pass through the grand fruit
country of Affghanistan.&nbsp; No Jungermannias are obtainable in this
part, nor anywhere indeed, except towards the true Himalayas.&nbsp;
I do not remember having seen the pomegranate growing at Cabul: the
place is too cold for it.&nbsp; I think however, I can get some from
Khujjah, where snow lies in winter.&nbsp; I leave for the Provinces
early in October, and shall travel 30 miles a day.&nbsp; I want to get
to Seharunpore, 15 or 20 days in advance of my time, as I must run up
to Mussoorie and fish in the Dhoon.&nbsp; I shall be in Calcutta in
all February.&rdquo;</p>

<i>September</i> <i>26th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I despatch to-morrow the first of the bits of wood, the duplicates
will be sent on the 28th or 29th: on this latter day I leave for Peshawur,
and right glad am I that the time has come at last.&nbsp; I will send
you the same woods from Peshawur, but shall scarcely be able to send
you pomegranate from any thing like a cold place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On receiving your specimens of vine, the following question
occurred to me.&nbsp; If wood is a deposit from the leaves or fibres
sent down from the leaves, how is the presence of wood to be accounted
for in tendrils, which have no leaves, but yet which are evidently branches?&nbsp;
The theory of the formation of wood, which considers it as above, is
deemed ingenious, but it will not I think be found to be true.&nbsp;
The bark evidently has a great deal to say to the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be most rejoiced at a remote prospect of again setting
to work.&nbsp; I take no interest now in the vegetation of this country.&nbsp;
I hope to be at Loodianah <i>early</i> in November; my present intention
is to run up to Simla, thence to Mussoorie, and descend on Seharunpore.&nbsp;
If I do this, I shall only leave one point unfinished, and that is the
Hindoo-koosh Proper, where however I shall have the advantage of Major
Sanders of the Engineers, who will pick up a few plants for me.&nbsp;
I wish much to take notes of the vegetation about Simla and Mussoorie,
this I can do at a bad season.&nbsp; I shall afterwards be able to compare
the Himalayan chain at very distant points.&rdquo;</p>

-- 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send you to-morrow dissections of Santalum if I can
get a small bottle for them: under &frac12; inch lens you can easily
open the pistillum of Santalum having previously removed the perianth:
it is a concial body; you must take care to get it out entire, especially
at the base, then place it in water, and dissect off the ovula of which
there are three or four, as per sketch.&nbsp; I shall not say what I
see, as I want to have your original opinion unbiassed, etc.; but whenever
you see the tubes with filaments adhering to their apices, pray mark
attentively what takes place, both at the point and at the place where
the tube leaves the ovulum; your matchless 1/1500 would do the thing.&nbsp;
Try iodine with all such, after having examined them in water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you find any difficulty in dissecting away the ovula,
light pressure under glass will relieve you.&nbsp; I shall be very anxious
to know what your opinion is, particularly with regard to the tubes
and all adhering filaments; the question now occupying botanists, being
this, is the embryo derived directly from the boyau or is it derived
from some parts of the ovulum?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you can understand these sketches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a shame it is that botanists should know nothing whatever
of the formation and structure of wood!&nbsp; They look at a section
of a piece of oak, and imagine they have discovered the secret, and
write volumes on this imagination, yet they have been told over and
over again, that nothing is to be learnt on such subjects without beginning
at the commencement, which they are too idle to do.&nbsp; To name an
abominable Aster, is among them of much higher importance than to discover
the cause of the growth of wood.&nbsp; Medullary rays are most difficult,
because they are very often deficient particularly in climbers.&nbsp;
I am horridly idle, and yet what can I do without books; yet with regard
to books, the more originality we possess, the less we require them?&nbsp;
There is nothing to be got here except a few marsh plants coming into
flower.&nbsp; One beautiful Chara, which might disclose the secret,
had I good glasses, it is a most graceful pellucid form, an undescribed
duckweed, a floating Marchantiace&aelig;.&nbsp; Would that I was settled
with a Ross on one hand, and a Strongstein on the other, around my collections
with good health and good spirits.&nbsp; Tell ---- I have in view the
division of the vegetable kingdom analagous to radiata, they include
all the Marchantiace&aelig;, and are, to all intents and purposes, Vegetable
Radiata.&rdquo;</p>

<i>1st</i> <i>march</i> <i>beyond</i> <i>Kooner</i>: <i>January</i>
<i>29th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be a letter of odds and ends, you know I was to
return to Jallalabad; well I reached that place, but left the encampment
and crossed the river, where an advance road making partly for the Kooner
expedition were employed, and having originally determined on going
to Kooner, I accompanied them two marches, when they were overtaken
by the army, to avoid which, I halted one day, and on the next proceeded
onwards by the north bank of the river, thus saving all the fords of
this horrid river.&nbsp; I should call it beautiful at any other season.&nbsp;
The road was bad, and the last one and a half mile into camp most difficult,
the path winding round and over spurs of sharp limestone rocks which
must have had abundance of silex in them they were so very hard.&nbsp;
At the very worst part, my headman being in front, all of a sudden I
heard three shots in quick succession with the usual hallooing, and
then I was called on in advance, meeting my headman wounded: he has
lost the two fore-fingers of his right hand.&nbsp; All I saw was three
men scrambling up the face of the hill, on whom I opened a fire as soon
as my guns came up, and had the pleasure of hitting one on the shield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a scene ensued! for when there are three or four on such
occasions we may reasonably expect thirty or forty, and my object was
to get out of the bad road, and so be close to camp.&nbsp; Some of,
or rather all, my people became dismayed, I had therefore to cheer,
to point my double barrels, and in fact to enact a whole legion.&nbsp;
One fellow tried to shoot me but his powder proved faithful, the others
were wounded: however they kept in sight, and to make matters worse,
in one place within twenty yards, six or seven of my loads were thrown;
evening drawing on, and prospects disgusting, when at last having passed
over one bad part and got down into a ravine, a number of people were
seen closing down on us, but my man had run off to camp, and by shouts
succeeded in calling five or six <i>sepahis</i>, part of the rear-guard,
to our relief, and so we escaped bag and baggage, the rascals making
off when the red coats appeared.&nbsp; I was sick at heart at the loss
of poor Abdool Rozak&rsquo;s fingers: he is an Arab with an English
heart, bearing his loss most manfully, and when his fingers were removed
expressed anxiety alone about me and my <i>Sundoogs</i> (collections).&nbsp;
Well then, where should I have been had I been assailed as Abdool Rozak
was, I should have been unprepared, and if riding, my mare would certainly
have jumped into the river beneath.&nbsp; Thomson <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a">{0a}</a>
said when he left me, G---, you are rash and Abdool Rozak is rash, take
care or you will get into trouble.&nbsp; My moving about without a guard
was imprudent, and I now return to Jallalabad to get one, or if not
successful to wait there until the spring and its floral excitements
call me out: what I dislike is danger without any recompense, not a
flower is to be had; with excitement it is nothing.&nbsp; I have now
had two escapes, one from the buffalo in Assam, and this, which is a
greater one, because had not the army been delayed by accident at the
ford, it would have been eight or ten miles in advance, and consequently
there would have been no rear-guard at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country is disturbed, and one can only stir out in the
valley itself close to camp, which is the more tantalizing as the mountains
are accessible, and covered with forest.&nbsp; Our halt here should
put us in possession of much information respecting these forests.&nbsp;
As it is, I shall leave probably as wise as I came, except in having
ascertained that the change from the well-wooded Himalaya mountains
to those of the Hindoo-koosh, without even a shrub five feet high, takes
place to the east of this.&nbsp; My employment is surveying and collecting
data for ascertaining the heights of the hills around.&nbsp; But wherever
I turn, the question suggests itself, what business have I here collecting
plants, with so many in Calcutta demanding attention?&nbsp; How I am
living! alone, without a table, chair, wine, or spirits, with a miserable
beard, and in native clothes! but one thus saves much time; how unfortunate
that mine now is not worth saving!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been reading Swainson&rsquo;s volumes in Lardner&rsquo;s
Cyclop&aelig;dia, in which there is a little to which severe critics
may object, but a vast deal more that is beautifully sound.&nbsp; I
am quite certain I never appreciated them before.&nbsp; How wonderful
that no one before Macleay and Swainson thought that living beings were
created on one plan.&nbsp; I have imbibed all the important parts with
the hope of bringing them to bear on Botany, which is in a shameful
state.&nbsp; One talks of the typical nature of polypetalous or monopetalous
plants; another ridicules the idea, because as he wisely says, some
polypetalous plants are monopetalous, and vice versa!! he objects, in
fact to what constitutes the great value of a character, <i>its</i>
<i>mode</i> <i>of</i> <i>variation</i>.&nbsp; All Swainson&rsquo;s propositions
appear to me philosophical and highly probable, but none of the present
generation have eyes young enough to bear such a flood of light as he
has thrown upon them.&nbsp; There are faults I acknowledge, but a man
who writes for money does not always write for fame; rapid writing and
much more rapid publishing is a vast evil, but one which is too often
unavoidable.&nbsp; I have four or five drawings of fish, one of the
spotted carnivorous carp, the most carnivorous type of all except Opsarion,
and perhaps a new subgenus; <a name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b">{0b}</a>
one of the Sir-i-Chushme and Khyber <i>Oreinus</i>, and a Perilamp with
two long cirrhi on the upper lip.&nbsp; I intend in my travels now I
am alone, to stop at every fertile place.&nbsp; I am ascertaining the
limit of the inferior snow in these latitudes, which I fancy will be
3,500 feet.&nbsp; Is it not curious that here 1,000 feet above Jallalabad
we have had no snow, while at Jallalabad there has been abundance.&nbsp;
I attribute it to the narrowness of the valley at this place, and to
the forest.&nbsp; When I glance at the subject of botanical geography,
how astounding appears our ignorance! we have no data, except to determine
the mere temperature and amount of rain yet men will persist in the
rage for imperfect description of undescribed species, and pay no attention
to what is one of the most important agents in preserving things as
they are in our planet,&mdash;i.e. vegetation.&nbsp; On this point Swainson
is less happy than on others when he ascribes such importance to temperature,
and points out the fact that countries in the same latitudes, and having
the same temperatures, produce different animals.&rdquo;</p>

<i>September</i> <i>25th</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am just on the eve of re-entering Cabul from a visit to
Bamean, a singular place on the other side of the Hindoo-koosh, celebrated
for its idols and caves.&nbsp; It has amply repaid a march of 106 miles
and back again.&nbsp; I never saw a more singular place, and never enjoyed
myself more: we crossed several high ridges between 11 and 13,000 feet,
but so poor is the flora that I have only added 200 species to my catalogue,
now amounting to 1200 species instead of 2,400 as I fully expected.&nbsp;
But I must say I was as much pleased at the acquisition of a genuine
<i>Salmo</i> in the Bamean river (which is a tributary of the Oxus,)
as at any thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately we were so hurried, that I had only one afternoon
and that an unfavourable one, for indulging in my fishing propensities:
the chief fish seems to come very near the English trout, and so far
as I can judge, is not found on this side the Himalaya.&nbsp; The other
fish of these rivers are a fine Schizothorax or Oreinus, allied to the
<i>Adoee</i>, a flat-headed Siluroid, a loach, and a small Cyprinus.&nbsp;
This is a singular country, quite unlike any thing I have seen, and
as distinct from the Himalaya in its vegetation, etc. as can well be
imagined.&nbsp; Generally it is very barren, and after travelling over
so much of the country I have yet seen only three parts of it decently
cultivated.&nbsp; It is reported to be rich in minerals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will never bear comparison with Hindoostan.&nbsp; It
is however capable of much improvement.&nbsp; It consists of a succession
of barren valleys, divided from each other by barren ridges, and is
generally deficient in the great fertilizer of all things&mdash;water.&nbsp;
There is scarcely an indigenous tree in the whole country, and generally
very few cultivated ones, except about Cabul, although they have poplars
and willows well suited to the climate.&nbsp; It has been subjected
to so much misrule that the natives have become indifferent to its improvement,
(if they ever felt alive to any such interest.)&nbsp; The Zoology is
very poor, quite at zero.&nbsp; There is a species of Ibex, an <i>Ovis</i>,
and a <i>Capra</i>, which from the frequency of their heads and horns
about sacred places and gateways of towns, must be common; but I have
never seen more than a portion of one fresh specimen of the sheep.&nbsp;
Furs are brought from the Hindoo-koosh, but are all too mutilated to
be of any use, except to a Zoologist with antiquarian eyes: one Jerboa.&nbsp;
Hares are rather common in some parts, and about here there is a Lagomys.&nbsp;
Of birds there are but few, but as the vegetation is chiefly vernal,
these creatures may perhaps be abundant.&nbsp; The game birds are quail,
three species of partridge, a huge Ptarmigan?&nbsp; Pterocles of Loodianah.&nbsp;
The fauna is richest in Saurian reptiles, and of these one might make
a very good collection.&nbsp; I have only seen two snakes, and both
are I believe lost.&rdquo;</p>

<i>April</i> <i>26th</i>, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Request --- to refrain from abusing compound microscopes.&nbsp;
Why should not compound and simple microscopes each have their merits?&nbsp;
Valentine, who is a great authority, and an unrivalled dissector, says,
the simple lens must be suspended.&nbsp; I only wish I could dissect
with a compound microscope: what things might not one get access to.&nbsp;
The simple lens is quite useless with opaque objects; it only does for
transmitted light.&nbsp; Now dissections of opaque objects have been
too much neglected.&nbsp; How odd it is that all improvements are ridiculed
at first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enclose a bit of Sphagnam, a curious moss, with curious
incomplete spiral cells in the leaves.&nbsp; I dare say it will bear
preservation in Canada balsam.&nbsp; I have received a new microscope,
a queer-looking thing, very portable; one object glass of a quarter
inch focus, by Ross; two eye-pieces magnifying linearly 200 to 300 times.&nbsp;
I have put it up, but I am not well enough to decide on its merits.&nbsp;
Now that I have arranged all my things, I am literally frightened at
the work I have to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite annoyed at the idea that German artists make better
microscopes than English.&nbsp; I was aware that the lenses were better,
but otherwise I imagined that any comparison would be vastly in our
favour.&nbsp; I am curious to know the price, and where to apply for
one, as your account makes me quite ashamed of mine.&nbsp; Who knows
what a fine penetrating power of 1100 may not disclose.&nbsp; I am very
much pleased with your idea of anointing cuts with nitrate of silver;
this hint I will bear in mind.</p>

<p>(I send this list as all the specimens are not lost, and some are
among the plants.&nbsp; Most of the species are, I think, distinct,
and when they have appeared to me not to be so, I have generally noted
it on the spot.</p>
<p>The mountain forms are very distinct, the mouth being under the snout,
or head, the intestines long, peritoneum covered with a black pigment.&nbsp;
These forms commence at Dadur, 800 feet above the sea: this stream abounds
in rapids.</p>
<p>Gurmab is 1,100 feet.&nbsp; Quettah, 5,600 feet.&nbsp; Lora river,
3,600 feet.&nbsp; Urghundab, 3,600 feet.</p>
<p>These lists may be of some small use compared with Burnes&rsquo;s
collection.&nbsp; To a certain extent they may be useful as showing
the preponderance, etc. of certain forms.&nbsp; You may rely on my distinctions
between Cyprinid&aelig;, Silurid&aelig;, and Percid&aelig;.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow I will send the other list of specimens No. 3, which
will I hope reach you; of all the fish in these parts, the Sir-i-Chushme
and Cabul river <i>Oreinus</i> travels farthest up.&nbsp; I have caught
it at nearly 11,000 feet in the Helmund river.&nbsp; Then come loaches,
and the beautiful trout-like Opsarion; other Cyprinid&aelig; ascend
2,000 or 3,000 feet, the Mahaseer scarcely more.&nbsp; Above that, come
the genuine mountain forms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Memorandum</i>
<i>on</i> <i>return</i> <i>from</i> <i>Afghanistan</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I considered on my arrival at Peshawur in December 1839,
that a great deal remained to be done, I obtained permission to remain
another season in Affghanistan.&nbsp; I immediately mentioned my wishes
of travelling to General Avitabili, who strongly advised me not to attempt
leaving Peshawur in any novel direction, as the whole of his district
was much disaffected.&nbsp; Soon afterwards I heard of an expedition
being on the point of leaving Jallalabad for Kooner, and I determined
on joining it.&nbsp; I re-traversed the Khybur Pass alone, and arrived
at Jallalabad just in time to go in the advance.&nbsp; I was present
at Pushut, 18th January 1840; and on the return of the force I remained
behind with Captain Macgregor.&nbsp; In February 1840 I accompanied
Captain Macgregor to Chugur-Serai, and thence to Otipore or Chugur-Serai-Balu
on the immediate frontier of Kaffiristan, and through his influence
I was enabled to remain there, and to increase my materials in an extremely
interesting direction.&nbsp; I remained about Otipore for some weeks,
making arrangements for penetrating into Kaffiristan and little Cashgur,
and in daily expectation of being joined by the late Capt. E. Connolly;
all my plans, which first seemed to promise success, were completely
frustrated by the disturbances which broke out in Bajore, consequent
on Meer Alum Khan&rsquo;s absence at Jallalabad.&nbsp; Capt. Connolly
barely escaped with his life from the hands of the Momauds.&nbsp; Meer
Alum Khan found on his return towards his government that he could not
leave Chugur-Serai, and at last, circumstances threatened so much around
Otipore and Chugur-Serai, that Meer Alum Khan insisted on my leaving
Otipore and on returning with him to Jallalabad.&nbsp; I did not leave
a moment too soon, for shortly after, Syud Hoshin turned Otipore by
crossing the hills to the north of Deogul, and very soon possessed himself
of Otipore.&nbsp; Meer Alum and I reached Jallalabad in safety, having
been attacked once on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remained at Jallalabad a few days, and was driven thence
to Khaggah by the necessity of obtaining medical aid.&nbsp; I reached
Khaggah in a high fever, and was confined to my bed for six weeks: during
my severe illness, I experienced the greatest kindness and attention
from Dr. Thomson and Dr. Andrew Paton, of the H. C. European Regt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early in July I proceeded to Cabul for change of air, and
as soon as I recovered a little strength, started to join Lieut. Sturly,
who was surveying on the Toorkistan frontier.&nbsp; I met that Officer
at Syghan the day he left to prosecute his surveys, which had been interrupted
by the Kamard disturbances: he was recalled to Syghan, in consequence
of heavier and more serious disturbance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I returned to Cabul, as I found it impossible to proceed beyond
Syghan, and then waited with impatience for a season that would enable
me to cross the Punjab without great risk to my still debilitated constitution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My establishment of collectors consisted of unintelligent
Affghans, who were particularly prone to abrupt abscondings, and my
supplies of materials and carriage very limited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The botanical collection is as extensive as could be expected
from the nature of the country and the climate.&nbsp; It is in excellent
order, consisting of about 1500 species, and a great number of duplicates.&nbsp;
This collection has been formed on the principles which have guided
me on former travels.&nbsp; Those principles I conceive to require the
collection of every form in numbers, and in various localities, so that
the geographical limits of each may be estimated, and the examination
be open.&nbsp; They also require information as to habitat, locality,
climate, whether the plants are gregarious or not, and whether they
contribute to giving peculiar features to the country.&nbsp; I do not
hesitate to say that this collection contains almost all the plants
that existed in flower or fruit along the line of march of the army
between Cabul and Syghan, about Chugur-Serai, Otipore, and Pushut, and
in the neighbourhood of Khaggah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The extent over which it was formed is about 1,600 miles,
and on the variety of geographical position a considerable part of its
value depends.&nbsp; If the plants between Cabul and Peshawur are less
rich, as my journeys between those cities always occurred at unfavourable
seasons, the deficiency has been lessened by my friend Dr. Ritchie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ornithological portion of the collection, consists of
about 350 specimens, is in good order, and contains many objects of
interest, valuable for throwing some light on the geographical distribution
of birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the fish of the various tracts I paid considerable attention,
but owing to the difficulties of travelling and of climate, the collection
has suffered severely.&nbsp; At Shikarpore I made an extensive collection
of the fish of the Indus.&nbsp; I had collected most of the fish of
the river, of the Bolan Pass, of the streams of Quettah, and of the
Urghundab, near Candahar, unfortunately I relied too much on the preservative
powers of alcohol.&nbsp; Subsequently I took the additional precaution
of preserving skins separately; and it is to these which amount to about
150 specimens, that the collections are chiefly limited.&nbsp; The collections
contain the fish of the Cabul river, between its source near Sir-i-Chushme,
and Peshawur, of the Helmund at an altitude of 11,500 feet, of the Bamean
river, and of the Chenab, Ravee, and Sutledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This collection is particularly interesting, as showing that
while the plants, quadrupeds, and birds of the southern and northern
declivities of the Kohi-Baba, the continuation of the Hindoo-koosh,
are much alike, yet that a total difference exists in their fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Keane, and Sir Willoughby Cotton, left me in complete
possession of my own time, a great kindness due no doubt to the considerate
instructions of Lord Auckland, but for which I was not the less grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always found Sir Alexander Burnes very considerate and very
willing to forward my views, and put me in possession of information.&nbsp;
The late Dr. Lord also showed himself anxious to assist me in my duties,
and very kindly asked me to join the Mission to Toorkistan, so suddenly
put an end to by a suspected outbreak in Kohistan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Captain Macgregor I was under great obligations during
the whole time I continued in his district.&nbsp; Through his influence
I was enabled to remain at the outer borders of Kaffiristan; and that
deservedly warm respect which he was held in by all the chiefs, would,
I am confident, have gained me access into Kaffiristan, and towards
Cashgur, at any less unsettled period.&nbsp; I have seen Captain Macgregor
in the closet and in the field, and I cannot sufficiently express the
respect with which I have had cause to regard him in both situations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Sanders, of the Bengal Engineers, was always eager
to swell my stock of materials, and during periods of occasional indisposition,
I relied almost entirely on him.&nbsp; Captain Sanders had also made
for me a collection of plants between Candahar and Herat, which, I regret
to say, was nearly entirely destroyed in crossing one of the rivers
on that route.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to Dr. Ritchie, of the Bombay Medical Service, the companion
of the justly celebrated Major Pottinger, during his return from Herat
via Jhomunna, that the Botanical collections are mostly indebted.&nbsp;
Dr. Ritchie not only placed unreservedly at my disposal a very interesting
collection made on that journey, but also a larger one made between
Peshbolak and Peshawur.&nbsp; Both these are of considerable value,
the one shows that the Affghan forms prevail as far as Herat on both
sides of the Paropamisus, the other shows that Affghanistan, even in
its hottest parts, has a majority of European forms.&nbsp; To the contents
of these collections, notes of the localities are also added, enhancing
their value very considerably.&nbsp; I may be excused for adding, that
Dr. Ritchie is acquainted with route surveying; in this and his knowledge
of Botany, he possesses two valuable requisitions of a traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Grant, of the Bombay Medical Service, formerly in Medical
charge of Dr. Lord&rsquo;s Mission, liberally presented me with an excellent
series of specimens from the valley of Syghan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I am beyond measure indebted for Zoological collections,
to Captain Hay, of the European Regiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The following notes addressed to Emanuel Fernandez, plant
collector at Malacca, may perhaps be useful as containing instructions
for the collection and transmission of plants and seeds.&nbsp; They
are perhaps worthy of insertion on other grounds, as an example of the
painstaking, and patient manner in which Mr. Griffith made his wishes
known to the persons employed by him in his pursuits.&rdquo;</p>
<pre>* * * * *</pre>
<p><i>To</i> <i>Emanuel</i> <i>Fernandez</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have received the open box of seeds, and the large case
of plants, per <i>&lsquo;Tenasserim</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Ebool seeds
were coming up, the dried plants are in good order, and are of very
good kinds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you put in the palms and fruits with other collections,
you should see that they are quite dry, as otherwise they rot and injure
the dried plants.&nbsp; When you send up more fruits, etc. put them
into open rattan baskets, so that they may be aired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send a list of palms and <i>rotans</i> wanted very much,
and two more glazed cases for seeds: water the earth inside a day before
closing the boxes and sending them off to Singapore.&nbsp; Whenever
you get any good seeds, dry them, and put them in a letter, directed
to me.&nbsp; Seeds spoil by being kept, particularly if kept among wet
fruits and dried plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can get flower-pots in Malacca buy two or three dozen,
and whenever you get seeds sow them in a pot, and keep them, until you
have enough pots filled to occupy one of the cases, then put mould between
the pots, and sow more seeds in this mould, fasten the lid down and
send off the box to Singapore.&rdquo;</p>
<pre>* * * * *</pre>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May</i>
<i>30th</i>, 1843.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cases of plants, etc. have arrived: the fresh plants were
nearly all dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You planted them very well, and cleverly, but some how or
other the lids of the boxes were nailed down, and so the plants died;
because plants will not live without light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the Ebool seeds have sprouted, one Lanjoot arrived
alive, and also the Pakoo Galowe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send soon two glazed cases, in which you may put plants
as before, and seeds of palms, or any good plants: sow them in the same
manner, and three or four days before the cases are despatched water
the earth and plants moderately; then screw down the lid, when the plants,
if they have rooted in the earth, will not die, because the glass admits
light to them.&nbsp; But to be sure of the plants having rooted, you
must keep the cases with you for three weeks, and if any plants are
sickly, take them out and put in others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send a list: when your next despatch arrives, I will increase
your pay.&nbsp; If you send plenty of seeds, etc. often, that is once
a month or six weeks, I will keep you in my service even if I do not
come back to Malacca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also send a box with a large bottle in it of spirits of
wine, this is for monkey cups (Nepenthes).&nbsp; Take the finest ones
you can get of all sorts, and put them in the bottle, leaves and all,
do not squeeze them into the bottle, then send it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<pre>* * * * *</pre>
<p>&ldquo;I send two empty glazed cases for plants: when these reach
you, fill them with moist earth and plant in them ripe fresh seeds of
the following palms * * *&nbsp; You need not wait until you have obtained
all, but such only as you can get at once; but remember when you have
got ripe seeds of any kind to sow them in the case.&nbsp; Take care
the earth is not too wet.&nbsp; The seeds you sent, sown in an open
box, came up, and we have now six or seven live Ebools, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send me up some ripe fruits and seeds of the Epoo, those you
sent were not ripe.&nbsp; If you can get any ripe ones, also sow some
with the palm seeds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you prepare Rotangs do not cut off the stalk of the leaf
close to the stem, but six inches from it, and do not cut off the thorns,
but tie all up in mats or gunny bags: at the same time send the leaves
of each dried in paper like other plants and flowers, all with names
written plainly in English and Malay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send live plants according as you receive boxes for them.&rdquo;</p>
<pre>* * * * *</pre>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you find ripe fruits or seeds, dry them in the sun,

<p>&ldquo;The plants dried and living have been received, and do you
great credit.&nbsp; The live plants particularly are in excellent order.&nbsp;
I have sent two more cases, when they reach you, fill them as you have
done before, and despatch them to me.&nbsp; I send some cards on which
you can write the names plainly, and tie them on the specimens.&nbsp;
I will also send you a pocket English Dictionary, and make you a present

<h2>PRIVATE JOURNALS OF WM. GRIFFITH, F.L.S.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p><i>When</i> <i>proceeding</i> <i>with</i> <i>the</i> <i>Assam</i>
<i>Deputation</i> <i>for</i> <i>the</i> <i>Examination</i> <i>of</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Tea</i> <i>Plant</i>.</p>
<p><i>September</i>, <i>1835</i>.&mdash;We arrived at Pubna on the 9th
of September, and left it on the following morning, pursuing the course
of the Pubna &ldquo;Karee,&rdquo; which is exceedingly tortuous and
of about an average width of 100 yards.&nbsp; On the evening of the
10th, we halted in the same river near its termination.&nbsp; This morning
we reached the &ldquo;Beera,&rdquo; into which the Pubna Karee enters,
and which at the mouth presents a vast expanse of water.&nbsp; Among
the jheels which occur on every side, we noticed in abundance the <i>Tamarix</i>
<i>dioica</i>.&nbsp; About noon we entered a narrow river, and in the
evening a very narrow creek in which in two places we experienced a
great difficulty in getting the boats along.&nbsp; We noticed <i>Alpinia</i>
<i>allughas</i>, <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> <i>pubescens</i>, <i>Oxystelma</i>
<i>esculentum</i>, <i>Apluda</i> <i>aristata</i>, in abundance.&nbsp;
Up to this period the two most conspicuous grasses continue to be <i>Saccharum</i>
<i>spontaneum</i>, and <i>Andropogon</i> <i>muricatus</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>13th</i>.&mdash;Arrived at Shiraz-gunge, about
half-past 8 A.M., from which place the people say Jumalpore is a three
days&rsquo; journey.&nbsp; The country through which we proceeded after
leaving Shiraz-gunge is nothing but a net-work of rivers, several of
vast size, and low islands, occupied almost exclusively by <i>Saccharum</i>
<i>spontaneum</i>, and in some places abounding in <i>Typha</i> <i>elephantina</i>,
in fruit.&nbsp; We halted at a small village in the evening, where we
procured <i>Centrostachys</i> <i>aquatica</i>.</p>
<p><i>September</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Came in sight of distant very
elevated land, which we suppose to be the Kassiya Hills.&nbsp; This
morning (15th) the Hills are very plain, and bear nearly due north.&nbsp;
The country through which we passed yesterday presented no change whatever.&nbsp;
<i>Andropogon</i> <i>muricatus</i> has now nearly left us; but the <i>Saccharum</i>
reaches to a large size, and is incredibly abundant.&nbsp; The natives
use it for thatching their huts.&nbsp; We were visited by a heavy squall
in the evening.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;Strong winds from an easterly direction.&nbsp;
About noon we succeeded in reaching a creek, in which we are completely
sheltered.&nbsp; During our route here, we were employed in examining
a new species of <i>Crotalaria</i>, and one of <i>Mitrasacme</i>! In
pools close to us are <i>Damasonium</i> <i>indicum</i>, <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>
<i>c&aelig;rulea</i>, <i>Myriophyllum</i> <i>tetrandrum</i>, <i>Polygonum</i>
<i>rivulare</i>, and a species of <i>Villarsia</i>, <i>V</i>. <i>cristata</i>.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;Left the creek, and arrived at Jumalpore about
2 P.M.; the cantonment of which occupies the right-hand side of the
Burrampooter, along the bank of which the officers&rsquo; houses are
situated; indeed this is the only dry line about the place, as immediately
inland there are nothing but jheels and rice fields.&nbsp; Jumalpore
is about &frac34; of a mile from the junction of the Jenai with the
Burrampooter or rather from the point of exit of the former river.</p>
<p><i>24th</i>.&mdash;We left the cantonment about 11 A.M., and proceeded
down the Burrampooter, which is a very uninteresting river, and appears
more like a net-work of water and sand banks; opposite Jumalpore, the
banks are about a mile apart, but the distance between the extreme banks,
leaving the island opposite the cantonment out of the question, is much
more.&nbsp; During the dry weather this part of the river is passable,
and indeed is in some places nothing but a dry bed of sand, so that
people walk across it.&nbsp; During our stay at the above place we met
with many interesting and new plants, among which a new species of <i>Villarsia</i>
occupied the most prominent place.&nbsp; <i>Cyperace&aelig;</i>, <i>Gramine&aelig;</i>,
and aquatic <i>Scrophularine&aelig;</i> abound.&nbsp; <i>Solanum</i>
<i>spirale</i> occurs in abundance, and the trees commence to be clothed
with ferns.&nbsp; I observed only one <i>Epiphytica</i> <i>Orchidea</i>,
probably an <i>Aerides</i>.</p>
<p>The banks consist hitherto of nothing but sand, covered with <i>Saccharum</i>
<i>spontaneum</i>.&nbsp; <i>Andropogon</i> <i>muricatus</i> is scarcely
to be met with.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;We left Mymensing this morning, and proceeded
down the Burrampooter, the banks of which still present for the most
part nothing but a succession of sandy banks covered with <i>Saccharum</i>
<i>spontaneum</i>.&nbsp; The stream is not very rapid, and the river,
owing to the numerous islands and banks, does not present so imposing
an appearance as the Ganges.&nbsp; For the last week strong easterly
winds have prevailed.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;We entered the mouth of the Soormah, or, as the
natives seem to call it, the Barak.&nbsp; The water of this river or
portion of the Megna? is remarkably clear, compared with that of the
Ganges; as indeed is that of the Burrampooter.</p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;Some time after we entered the Soormah we apparently
left its channel, and up to this morning we have passed through a tract
of jheels with a few clear and very deep channels.&nbsp; The villages
are built on small eminences, and are entirely surrounded with water;
they have the usual form, and those houses adjoining the water have
fences of an <i>Arundo</i>, which they tell us are intended to keep
out the grass.&nbsp; We have since entering these jheels passed through
and between immense beds of vegetation, formed principally of <i>Oplismenus</i>
(Panicum) <i>stagninus</i>, <i>Leersia</i>? <i>aristata</i>, which by-the-bye
is a distinct genus.&nbsp; <i>Villarsia</i> <i>cristata</i>, <i>Nymph&aelig;alotus</i>,
Potamogeton, <i>Azolla</i> <i>Salvinii</i>, etc. etc.&nbsp; The only
novel things we have met with are <i>Isch&aelig;mum</i> <i>cuspidatum</i>,
Roxb. (sui generis,) and a small grass intermediate between Panicum
and Cham&aelig;raphis.&nbsp; The wild form of <i>Oryza</i> <i>sativa</i>,
<i>Panicum</i> <i>interruptum</i> and <i>Leersia</i>? <i>ciliaris</i>,
Roxb. also occur; the two former in abundance.&nbsp; On the more dry
tracts, that occasionally though very rarely occur, <i>Andropogon</i>
<i>muricatus</i> appears.&nbsp; No <i>Saccharum</i> presented itself
since the 28th.&nbsp; High ground was visible yesterday evening, apparently
at a great distance.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;We have continued to pass through
immense jheels: about 6 A.M. we arrived at Hubbe-gunge, a large native
town, situated on the Barak, which does not deserve the name of a river.&nbsp;
The actual distance from this place to Chattuc is about 42 miles, and
the high land in that direction was faintly visible for about 2 hours
in the morning.&nbsp; The ground to the Eastward is losing the &ldquo;Jheel&rdquo;
character, and appears densely wooded, and to the S.E. rather high hills
are visible.&nbsp; Altogether this land of jheels is very remarkable,
particularly on account of the great depth of the water, which except
in one point has hitherto always exceeded 6 feet, and yet the water
has fallen in all probability two or three more.&nbsp; As the head quarters
of tropical aquatic plants, it is well worthy of attention; the profusion
of <i>Leersia</i> <i>aristata</i>, Roxb. is immense, but this is almost
exceeded by <i>Oplismenus</i> <i>stagninus</i>.</p>
<p><i>On</i> <i>the</i> <i>3rd</i> <i>October</i>, we left the tract
of jheels, and proceeded by small rivers, overhung with jungle and fine
bamboos; on the 5th we re-entered the Soorma and proceeded down it to
Chattuc, which is situated on the left bank of the river, and which
we reached in the afternoon.&nbsp; During our passage down the river
we had beautiful views of the mountains, which do not however strike
one with an idea of great height.&nbsp; We could plainly distinguish
two or three waterfalls shooting over scarped precipices.</p>
<p><i>Churra</i> <i>Punjee</i>, <i>October</i> <i>30th</i>.&mdash;After
a residence of 20 days here, I wrote to Mr. Solly, stating nothing particular,
except that Bucklandia has coniferous tissue, and that Podostemon will
probably prove Monocotyledonous and allied to Pistiace&aelig;.&nbsp;
Our stay here has proved a source of great delight, and accumulation
of botanical and geological treasures.&nbsp; The cantonments of Churra
are at an elevation of 4200 feet above the sea, the native village being
situated half way up the ascent which closes in the table-land on which
the cantonment is situated towards the N. and W., and it is hence about
300 feet higher.&nbsp; The country immediately adjoining the cantonment
is flat, with here and there a rounded hillock, destitute of any covering
but grasses and a few low, half shrubby plants.&nbsp; To the Eastward
there is a very deep and beautiful valley, the west side of which in
particular is densely covered with jungle, but this does not contain
any large trees.&nbsp; The opposite side, fronting our bungalow, runs
nearly N. and S., presents a succession of ravines, and a most picturesque
and varied surface.&nbsp; This valley, along the bottom of which as
is usual a torrent runs, opens into the low country at Terrya Ghat,
which is situated at the foot of the ascent to Churra.&nbsp; Directly
to the south, and at a distance of about two miles from the cantonments,
there is another valley likewise occupied below by a torrent fed by
the Moosmai falls.&nbsp; The commencement of all these valleys, that
I have at least seen, is a sheer precipice, which often, and particularly
at Moosmai, assumes the form of a vast amphitheatre, over the brink
of which cascades, especially at Moosmai, fall in tolerable plenty.&nbsp;
It is in these places that the immense depth of the sandstone is best
seen; the depth of the valley of Moosmai is, I am told, 1500 feet, the
country above these precipices is generally level, and is in fact table-land.&nbsp;
The most beautiful valley is at Maamloo, a village to the Westward of
Churra, and about five miles distant.&nbsp; The approach to Churra is
pretty enough, and gives the best view of the cantonment.&nbsp; The
coal mines are to the Westward, and close to Churra.&nbsp; These I have
not yet seen; the coal is of the very best description, it does not
splinter, gives remarkably few ashes, affords an admirable fire and
the best coke.&nbsp; Water-courses are plenty about Churra, but the
body of water is at this season small, although it becomes considerable
after a few hours rain; it is then that the great fall at Moosmai becomes
really beautiful, the water shooting over the precipice and falling
into a bason about 150 feet below.&nbsp; By a succession of these falls,
although of more limited height, it at length reaches the bottom of
the valley.&nbsp; It is only on the precipices about the fall that the
Cham&aelig;rops appears to grow; at the foot of a precipice a little
to the right (going from Churra,) a tree fern grows, which I have Wallich&rsquo;s
authority for stating to be Polypod giganteum, a fern which occurred
at Mahadeb, and which I have seen in somewhat similar situations at
Mergui.&nbsp; All my excursions have been confined to this valley and
to the water-courses immediately around Churra; once only have I quitted
the table-land and proceeded to Maamloo, and yet in this very limited
space the profusion of objects has been such as to enable me only to
embrace a very limited proportion.&nbsp; The above excursion proved
very rich.&nbsp; About half way to Maamloo I discovered a solitary tree
fern (<i>Alsophila</i> <i>Brunoniana</i>,) and to the left, and up the
broken sides of the calcareous cliffs that occur here and between Maamloo
and Moosmai, a group of several magnificent specimens, of which on the
succeeding day we brought home three.&nbsp; We saw none above 30 feet,
although the specimen in the British Museum from these hills measures
45.&nbsp; Their axis is of small diameter, and is nearly cylindrical,
the vascular fascicles being disposed in covered bundles, often assuming
the form of a UU near the circumference of the very dense cellular tissue
of which the axis is chiefly composed.&nbsp; Towards the base it is
enveloped in an oblique dense mass of intermottled rigid fibres (roots)
which, as they are developed in the greatest extent, the nearer they
approach the base, give the trunk a conical form.&nbsp; Their growth
is essentially endogenous, and will probably be found when examined
aborigine to approximate to that of Cycade&aelig;, although these last
are of a more exogenous than endogenous nature.&nbsp; Nothing however
is known of the growth of Palms, Cycade&aelig;, or tree ferns.&nbsp;
I have above alluded to the calcareous rocks or cliffs; these are of
the same formation with those that occur so abundantly on the Tenasserim
coast, although they are much more rich in vegetation.&nbsp; These I
first saw at Terrya Ghat; like those of Burmah they abound in caves,
and assume the most varied and picturesque forms; they appear to be
the head quarters of Cyrthandrace&aelig;, of which we found a noble
species with the flower of a Martynia growing among the tree-ferns.&nbsp;
They are very rich in ferns and mosses, of which last near the tree-ferns
I gathered four species of four genera without moving a foot.&nbsp;
The cliffs in which, or at the foot of which the coal is found, bound
the Churra cantonments to the Westward.&nbsp; These are chiefly calcareous.&nbsp;
The entrance to Churra lies between this and the precipice at Moosmai.&nbsp;
Very few animals of any description are to be seen about Churra.&nbsp;
I have seen one small species of deer, about half as large again as
the mouse-deer of Mergui, and one young flying squirrel of a greyish
black colour, with a very bushy tail.&nbsp; Leopards are, they say,
not uncommon.&nbsp; Tigers do not generally come so high.&nbsp; Of birds,
I mean about Churra, there are several species of hawks, and their old
companions crows and swallows; but I have seen no sparrows, which is
singular enough.&nbsp; There is one beautiful species of jay, with crimson-orange
beak and legs, and a pretty king-fisher; but, except perhaps in the
valleys, birds, I should say, are very scarce.&nbsp; With respect to
shooting, scarcely any is to be had; wood-cocks are found in the dells
about Churra, but sparingly.&nbsp; I have seen only one snipe and one
quail.</p>
<p>Regarding the natives, I have little to say.&nbsp; They are a stout-built,
squat, big-legged hill tribe: the women in regard to shape being exactly
like their mates; and as these are decidedly ugly&mdash;somewhat tartarish-looking
people, very dirty, and chew pawn to profusion&mdash;they can scarcely
be said to form a worthy portion of the gentler sex.&nbsp; They appear
to be honest; but that is a quality which, from the example of their
European lords, they are said to be losing fast.&nbsp; They have no
written character; every thing being transmitted by tradition, and performed
by the interchange of tokens.&nbsp; They drink like fish, and manufacture
a bad kind of arrack, the pernicious effects of which were experienced
by the European invalids when the Sanatarium was in existence.&nbsp;
They pay respect to their dead by the erection of a sort of kairns and
large erect slabs of sandstone rounded off at the upper end: of these,
I believe, they put up three or five to each friend, according to their
means and, probably, rank.&nbsp; The Churra people cultivate nothing
but a little cotton, and perhaps a species of Eleasine.&nbsp; They depend
upon the plains for their support and supplies, and this is good management
since rice at Terrya Ghat is sold at 70 or 80 seers a rupee.&nbsp; Their
hire is, considering the cheapness of their food, very expensive; a
man being rated at four annas a day, a woman at three, and a boy at
two.&nbsp; I should add, that they have no caste.</p>
<p>The climate is certainly very cool and cold, the thermometer ranging
from about 56&deg; to 66&deg; in-doors at this time of the year.&nbsp;
The rains are said to be the coldest part of the year; they are excessive,
commencing in April and ceasing in October.&nbsp; It occasionally rains
for fifteen or sixteen days in succession, and without intermission;
and nine or ten inches have been known to fall in twenty-four hours.&nbsp;
Since we have been here, inclusive of this, we have had four days of
wet weather, of which three were continued rain.&nbsp; Both were ushered
in by the sudden irruption of heavy mists from below, which soon spread
over the country, obscuring every thing.&nbsp; These sudden irruptions
occur during the partial breaking up of the rain, during which time
the valleys are completely choked up with dense mists, the summits of
the hills on the opposite side to that on which one stands being alone
visible.&nbsp; After the rains were over, in the first instance, the
plains, or rather the mass of haze hanging over them, presented a most
curious spectacle.</p>
<p>The coldest weather we have yet experienced was at Maamloo, on the
27th, the thermometer at 8 P.M. being at 52&deg;.&nbsp; This is remarkable,
as Maamloo is rather below Churra.&nbsp; There is however a good deal
of wood round the place. <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a></p>
<p>With regard to Botany, the chief vegetation about Churra, as indeed
is at once indicated by the appearance of the country, consists of grasses.&nbsp;
Along the water-courses, which intersect this portion of the country,
<i>Bucklandia</i> <i>populnea</i>, a species of Ternstr&aelig;mia, Pandanus,
Eugenia, Camellia, are found; while Composit&aelig;, Eriocaulon, and
ferns abound in the same places.&nbsp; The vegetation of the valleys
is very rich and very varied; and, an affinity is indicated with the
botany of China by the existence of a species of Illicum, I. khascanam,
and several Ternstr&oelig;miace&aelig;.&nbsp; The great orders are grasses,
ferns, composit&aelig;.&nbsp; During a trip to Maamloo, a beautifully
situated village on the brink of the table-land, we discovered abundance
of the tree-fern <i>Alsophila</i> <i>Brunoniana</i>, the highest of
which measured 25 feet.&nbsp; The appearance of the tree is that of
a palm.&nbsp; The flora surrounding these tree-ferns we found to be
exceedingly rich.&nbsp; Among Nepal ferns, I may mention <i>Anisadenia</i>,
<i>Saxifraga</i> <i>ligulata</i>.</p>
<p><i>Interior</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Khasyah</i> <i>Mountains</i>.&mdash;On
the 2nd, we left for Surureem; at which place we halted a day.&nbsp;
Bucklandia here occurs, of a very large size, perhaps 50 or 60 feet.&nbsp;
It is a rugged-looking tree, many of the branches being decayed.&nbsp;
There we observed the first <i>Rhododendrum</i> <i>arboreum</i>.&nbsp;
Our next stage was to Moflong; during our march thither, or rather mine,
I had a fine view of the Himalayas, but not upon the regular road to
Moflong.&nbsp; The European forms certainly increased in number between
Surureem and the above place.&nbsp; Two great acquisitions occurred
on the road; a new Crawfurdia, and a Podostemon which W. has named after
me.&nbsp; This I found in the clear stream adjoining the Bogapanee growing
upon stones, and adhering to them very firmly.&nbsp; It is on the hills
about the Bogapanee that the firs first make their appearance, but do
not attain to any great size.&nbsp; The valley of the Bogapanee is exceedingly
deep, and both the descent and ascent are very difficult.</p>
<p>Moflong is a bleak exposed village and the bungalow or residence
for travellers very bad.&nbsp; The number of European forms we found
to increase considerably about this place.&nbsp; The only woods that
occur are of fir, but the trees are of no great size; their frequent
occurrence, however, stamps a peculiar feature on the scenery.&nbsp;
We here experienced nearly three days of continued rain, and, as the
place is bleak, we were miserable enough.&nbsp; We left for Myrung on
the 9th, and the greater and all the first part of the long march was
very uninteresting.&nbsp; At Mumbree, however, there is a decided improvement,
and the scenery is very good.&nbsp; One here notices the occurrence
of woods&mdash;of oaks, etc., and their form reminded me somewhat of
the woods of Buckinghamshire.&nbsp; No woods of fir occur; all the trees
occurring isolatedly.&nbsp; I should mention that the country between
Molee and Moflong is quite peculiar in geological structure, abounding
in Cyanite, the masses of which are of very considerable size.&nbsp;
I imagine that the vegetation farther on in this direction would be
more rich in European forms than elsewhere, at least between Churra
and Mingklow.</p>
<p>Myrung is certainly far superior in every point to any place that
we have yet seen; and, as the climate is peculiarly fine and the bungalow
good, the degree of enjoyment is as great as can be expected.&nbsp;
The features of the country are similar to those of Mumbree.&nbsp; The
groves or woods are composed chiefly of oaks, intermixed with Magnolias,
which attain a very large size.&nbsp; These forests seem all to have
a northern aspect.&nbsp; Orchide&aelig; abound in these woods, and so
far as herbaceous forms go, European vegetation is on the decrease.&nbsp;
From the bungalow one has occasionally a remarkably fine view of the
Himalayas, mountains intercepted by large tracts of very high land,
probably Bootan.&nbsp; The coldest weather we have experienced here
was when the thermometer sank to 46&deg;; even in the middle of the
day the sun is not oppressive.&nbsp; It is singular enough, that the
first attempts, so to speak, at a Fauna occur here.&nbsp; The woods
abound with small birds.&nbsp; I shot one squirrel, with a very short
tail and rounded head.&nbsp; Red deer (the Gyee of the Burmese) occur,
though rarely.&nbsp; Two or three solitary snipes may be found during
a day&rsquo;s excursion, and perhaps a brace of quail, which are nearly
as large as English partridges.&nbsp; Pheasants are reported to occur
in the woods.&nbsp; I should add, that both here and at Nunklow snipe
of a very large description, and of the habits of the solitary snipe,
are found in small numbers.&nbsp; They are very brown, as large as a
wood-cock, and their cry is that of a common snipe.&nbsp; Lieutenant
Townsend informs me, that these birds are a totally distinct species.&nbsp;
Lieutenant Vetch tells me, that the Khasiyas declare that they are the
females of the wood-cock, in other words, wood-hens, and that in March
wood-cocks abound in the places with these wood-hens.&nbsp; He likewise
informs me, that the only difference he could ascertain to exist between
these birds and wood-cocks, consists in their having very short and
thick legs.</p>
<p>I have seen two of this particular description, but have never shot
any.</p>

<img alt="View from Nunklow" src="images/p8.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>After Myrung one can speak much less in favour of these hills.&nbsp;
Nunklow is a pretty spot, and commands a really magnificent view of
the Himalayas, of the Bootan mountains, and of the plains of Assam.&nbsp;
Altogether this view is the finest which, in my limited experience,
I have ever seen: I did not however like Nunklow, nor do my wishes recur
to it. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9">{9}</a>&nbsp; The
route thither is pretty enough, and not fatiguing.&nbsp; I may mention
Nunklow as the station of some fine trees, among which is a Betula,
two &AElig;sculi, oaks, etc. in abundance.&nbsp; The pine is in fine
order, but not large.&nbsp; Much more cultivation is carried on in this
portion of the hills than elsewhere, and paddy is cultivated apparently
to some extent.&nbsp; The temperature is much warmer, and the air by
no means so bracing as that of Myrung.&nbsp; Perhaps at this place the
flora resemble that of lower Himalaya more than other places we have
yet seen.&nbsp; The march from Nunklow to Nowgong is very long, and,
as we started late, owing partly to mismanagement and partly to the
want of coolies, we were most agreeably benighted in the jungle.&nbsp;
The descent is very sudden and commences at Nunklow; the valley, on
the brink of which it is situated, being perhaps 2000 feet deep.&nbsp;
It is in this valley or on its walls that the finest pines we have seen
occur, but even here they do not attain a greater height than 60 feet,
and perhaps a diameter of a foot or a foot and a half.&nbsp; As Mr.
Brown of the Sillet Light Infantry informed me most correctly, many
would make fine spars; but Mr. Cracroft&rsquo;s language in one of the
Journals of the Asiatic Society when describing these firs, seems rather
overwrought.&nbsp; During our march I picked up a pretty species of
Sonerila.&nbsp; A small stream runs at the foot of the descent, by what
name it goes I know not.&nbsp; Near the Bustapanee, flowing along a
valley about two hours&rsquo; walk from the last mentioned water.&nbsp;
Wallich discovered abundance of his favourite and really splendid Polypodium
Wallichianum, which I may accuse with justice of being an additional
reason for our benightment.&nbsp; The stream is really the only respectable
river we have seen, or rather the second one that can be called a torrent,
the other being the Bogapanee.&nbsp; It boils along, and the body of
water is great, even at the season of the year at which we passed it.&nbsp;
It has forced enormous holes, frequently round, in the large masses
of rock that form its bed, and then in and a few yards beyond the bridge
of bamboos by which we crossed, it falls, they say, 70 feet into a fine
bason, which however is only partly visible from above.&nbsp; They who
have been on the edges of this bason say that the fall is really fine;
it certainly has not much of this when viewed from above, neither can
it, I think, even in the rains come up to Mr. Cracroft&rsquo;s description.&nbsp;
Moosmai is, <i>apr&egrave;s</i> <i>tout</i> I will venture to say, the
king of the falls between Terrya Ghat and Ranee Godown.&nbsp; On the
farther side of this water, small trees of Cycas first make their appearance,
but we had no time now or rather then to examine any thing.&nbsp; As
the shades of evening lengthened we quickened our paces, and at last
when it became dark, came up with the coolies in a most rugged road,
and when it was dark, after stumbling about a good deal, I made my way
to the foot of the descent, and reached a small stream, where we made
preparations for a halt, and where we passed the night, during which
we were treated with a slight shower of rain.&nbsp; As the season was
far advanced we all escaped, scot-free, from fever, and reached the
Bungalow called Nowgong about 10 o&rsquo;clock next morning, where we
spent the day.</p>

</a></p>
<p>From this time we were, I believe, all anxious to leave the hills,
which had lost all their charms, although the vegetation was still more
gigantic and interesting.&nbsp; But we were now confined to the road,
which is very good, all digressions being prevented by the thickness
of the jungles, and then in some places swarms of wild elephants.&nbsp;
These animals appear most numerous about Onswye, near which there is
a marshy place literally trodden up by them, and their tracks were so
fresh that no traces of Wallich or his coolies could be identified,
although they had preceded us only about half an hour.&nbsp; It was
in this particular place that I gathered a solitary specimen of <i>Butomus</i>
<i>pygm&aelig;us</i>.&nbsp; Beyond Nowgong, saul first comes into view,
and many trees attain a considerable size.&nbsp; Some fine ferns and
two beautiful Acanthace&aelig;, I may mention, as collected about that
place.&nbsp; We reached Jyrung by an easy march the next day; every
step adding only to a greater renewal of acquaintance with old faces,
or at least old plain plants.&nbsp; Between Jyrung and the foot of the
hills, we fell in with <i>Henslowia</i> <i>glabra</i> in fine flower:
Wallich took many fine specimens, all of which were males.&nbsp; This
species is, as well as the former, liable to deceive one as to the sex
of the plant; but all the seeming ovaries beginning to enlarge are due
to insect bites or punctures.&nbsp; To conclude: at the foot of the
hills we were embraced with <i>Marlea</i> <i>Begonifolia</i>, <i>Bauhinia</i>
<i>purpurea</i>, etc. almost exactly as at Terrya Ghat.&nbsp; Between
the foot of these really delightful hills and Ranee Godown, I fell in
with one plant only, deserving of mention, <i>Dischedia</i> <i>Rafflesiana</i>;
this is worthy of notice, as our Indian Asclipiferous species have not
hitherto been found, I believe north of Moulmain, nor otherwhere than
that peninsula and the archipelago.&nbsp; From Ranee Godown we had the
pleasure of walking nineteen miles to Gowahatty, which place we reached
on the 23rd November.</p>
<p>All I can say in its favour is, that it is very cold in the mornings,
always at this season cool; that it is very pretty, being situated on
the Burrampooter, and surrounded with hills; that the women are good-looking,
and the whole body of officers among the best.&nbsp; Of its botanical
riches I can only say, that in a short afternoon&rsquo;s excursion we
found <i>Cardiopterus</i> <i>harnulosa</i>, or rather saw it, and a
species of Apocynea in fruit, probably the same with one I have from
Tenasserim, and which is remarkable for the very many fleshy al&aelig;
of its fruit.&nbsp; Gowahatty is particularly known as the station for
<i>Cycas</i> <i>circinatis</i>, one fine specimen of which Captain Jenkins
shewed us, and the height of which is perhaps 20 or 25 feet.</p>
<p>It was dichotomous, but only once.&nbsp; The rings formed by the
scars of the foot stalks, as well as those of the fruit stalks, were
most distinct on the two branches only, and gave them a very rich and
less elated appearance.&nbsp; The examination of this specimen only
strengthens me in my opinion derived chiefly from examination of those
in the Botanic Gardens, that these rings which certainly afford the
age of each branch, one being added of either sort every year, are not
to be distinguished in the stem below its division.&nbsp; So that after
all, <i>Brongniart</i> is only half-wrong, although he is ignorant of
the saving clause.</p>
<p>I may add, that we were on the hills about thirty-eight days, of
which seven and a half were rainy, a proportion of 1 in 5&frac12;.</p>
<p><i>On</i> <i>the</i> <i>2nd</i> <i>December</i>, our party left Gowahatty
for Suddiya, on the morning of the 4th I proceeded in advance in Captain
Matthie&rsquo;s express canoe for Tezpoor, which place I reached on
the evening of the 6th, and at which I met with a most kind reception
from Captain Matthie, Principal Assistant to the Agent to the Governor
General, and in Civil charge of the district of Durrung.&nbsp; Tezpoor
possesses many advantages over Gowahatty, from which place it is about
120 miles distant, that is, following the river.&nbsp; It is situated
on the banks of what was once a portion of the Burrampooter, but which
is now nothing but a nullah, nearly dry at the present season.&nbsp;
It is a completely new place, <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12">{12}</a>
Captain Matthie having arrived here about a year since, at which time
it was a complete jungle.&nbsp; Some small hills run along the side
of the nullah, on one of which Captain Matthie&rsquo;s house is situated.&nbsp;
The clearings have already reached to a considerable extent, and there
are two good roads for buggies.&nbsp; The great advantage it has over
Gowahatty consists in its freedom from fogs, which evidently hug the
Meekur hills on the opposite side of the Burrampooter, bearing about
E.S.E. from Tezpoor.&nbsp; It is perhaps owing to the proximity of these
hills that Nowgong until 10 A.M. appears completely enveloped in fog,
while all round Tezpoor it is completely clear.</p>
<p>From this place the view of the Himalayas and of the intervening
Bootan hills is very fine.&nbsp; The chain is of considerable extent,
and presents three grand peaks, of which the most westerly one is the
largest.&nbsp; They do not appear very distant, and are distinctly seen
at this season at all times of the day.&nbsp; They are more soft and
picturesque towards evening, at which time the different shades are
better developed.&nbsp; The degrees of ascent of the Bootan hills are
well shewn; the hills forming the lowest range being of no considerable
height.&nbsp; It is at once obvious, that the ascent into Bootan from
this place would occupy several days.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p12.jpg">
<img alt="Captain Mathie&rsquo;s Cutcherry" src="images/p12.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The view to the S. and S.S.W. is barren enough, and is completely
flat; the country presenting nothing whatever but high grass, with an
occasional peep of the river.&nbsp; That to the north is, owing to the
Himalayas, very striking and picturesque.</p>
<p>Cultivation is carried on to a great extent about Tezpoor, and the
district is populous, although few villages are to be seen, as they
are all concealed among trees.&nbsp; Paddy is the principal grain cultivated,
and this is carried on in low places, which appear on a casual examination
to have been originally beds of rivers.&nbsp; Captain Matthie however
tells me, that many of these have abrupt terminations and commencements,
such may have been old jheels.&nbsp; Sursoo, opium, and sugar-cane are
likewise cultivated, especially the former.</p>
<p>The whole land indeed, with the exception of the rice-places and
the evidently old beds of the Burrampooter, are much more elevated than
the land round Gowahatty.&nbsp; Both Tezpoor and Durrung are consequently
less damp, and more healthy than the above-mentioned place.&nbsp; In
fact, as a residence I would infinitely prefer Tezpoor to Gowahatty.&nbsp;
With regard to the shikar, (shooting) both large and small game abound.&nbsp;
Tigers are frequent as well as bears.&nbsp; Buffaloes are to be seen
on the <i>churs</i> (islands) in large herds.&nbsp; Pea-fowl and jungle-fowl
abound, as well as water-fowl; floricans and partridges, both black
and red, are by no means unfrequent.</p>
<p><i>Upper</i> <i>Assam</i>, <i>Jan</i>. <i>15th</i>.&mdash;We arrived
at Kujoo, a rather large village of Singfos, and within half a day&rsquo;s
journey of which the tea is found in its native state.&nbsp; This is
the first Singfo village I have as yet seen, and is situated on the
skirts of a plain of small extent, and covered to all appearance by
extensive grass jungles, among which trees are interspersed.&nbsp; The
houses are not numerous, but they are of large size, and are raised
in the Burman fashion on piles from the ground.&nbsp; Within one, many
families are accommodated.&nbsp; The people themselves are fair, much
like the Burmese, but still quite distinct.&nbsp; The male dress resembles
the Burmese much; the female is more distinct, consisting chiefly of
a sort of <i>gown</i>; and whilst tattooing is confined to the males
in Burma, it here appears to be indulged in chiefly by the ladies; all
the legs I saw during the day, being ornamented with rings of tattoo.&nbsp;
The men are a stout, rather fine race; free, easy, and independent,
and great admirers of <i>grog</i> in every form.</p>
<p>During our journey hither, and indeed en route from Kujoo Ghat, we
passed over a clay soil and through a dense jungle, comparable to which
I have seen but little.&nbsp; Our direction has been nearly south from
the above place.&nbsp; The jungle consisted chiefly of trees, here and
there large patches of bamboo or tobacco occurring: there was but little
underwood.&nbsp; Among the trees the most gigantic was a species of
Dipterocarpus, probably the same with that I have gathered on Pator
hill, Mergui.&nbsp; We picked up likewise very large acorns with a depressed
lamellated cap, and two fruits of Castanea, one probably the same with
that from Myrung.&nbsp; But of all the vegetation, that of ferns is
the most luxuriant and most varied.</p>
<p><i>Jan</i>. <i>16th</i>.&mdash;This day we gave up to the examination
of the tea in its native place.&nbsp; It occurs in a deep jungle to
the south of the village, and at a distance of about three miles from
it.&nbsp; Our route thither lay through first a rather extensive grass
jungle, then through a deep jungle.&nbsp; We crossed the Deboru once
on our route; it is a mean and insignificant stream.</p>
<p>Nothing particular presents itself in the jungle until you approach
the tea, on which you come very suddenly.&nbsp; This plant is limited
to a small extent, perhaps to 300 yards square, the principal direction
being N. and S.&nbsp; It grows in a part of the jungle where the soil
is light and dryish, and throughout which, <i>ravinules</i> are frequent,
due, Mac. tells me, to the effect of rain dropping from the heavy over-shadowing
foliage on a light soil.&nbsp; In addition to this, small mounds occur
about the roots of the large trees; but chiefly around bamboos, which
are by no means unfrequent.&nbsp; This, however, is of common occurrence
in all bamboo jungles.&nbsp; The underwood consists chiefly of Rubeace&aelig;,
a small Leea, Cyrthandrace&aelig; and Filices, <i>Polypodium</i> <i>arboreum</i>,
<i>Angiopteris</i> <i>orassipes</i>, and a large Asplenium are common.&nbsp;
Among the arbuscles are a large leaved Tetranthera, a Myristica, Anonace&aelig;,
<i>P&aelig;derioidea</i> <i>f&aelig;tidissima</i>, foliis ternatis;
stipulis apicee subulata, 3-fidis, etc.&nbsp; And among the forest trees
are a vast Dipterocarpus, the same we met with en route to Kujoo, <i>Dillenia</i>
<i>speciosa</i>, etc.&nbsp; Piper and Chloranthus are likewise not uncommon.&nbsp;
There is no peculiar feature connected with the existence of the tea
in such a place, and in such a limited extent.&nbsp; We were fortunate
enough to find it both in flower and fruit, owing to its site; its growth
is tall and slender, and its crown at least that of the smaller, very
small and ill developed.&nbsp; Large trees are rare; in fact, they have
been all cut down by the Singfos, who are like all other natives excessively
improvident.&nbsp; The largest we saw, and which Wallich felled, was,
including the crown, 43 feet in length.&nbsp; Small plants are very
common, although Bruce had already removed 30,000.&nbsp; Mac. thinks
they grow chiefly on the margins of the ravinules or hollows.&nbsp;
Their leaves were all large, of a very dark green, and varying from
four to eight inches in length.&nbsp; The pith of the tree felled was
excentric, the greater development taking place as usual on the southern
side; it was two and a half inches N., three and a half S.; but about
10 feet above the base this excentricity was nearly doubled.&nbsp; The
wood is very compact, and the tree apparently one of slow growth.&nbsp;
The largest that Bruce has seen, and which he felled last year, was
29 cubits in length.&nbsp; The jungle was so thick that all general
views as to its real extent, and the circumstances limiting it, must
be very superficial.&nbsp; To the East the cessation of the lightness
of the soil and of the hollows is very abrupt, and strongly influences
the tea, only a few small straggles being visible in that direction.&nbsp;
The jungle here was choked with grasses, and the large viscous Acanthace&aelig;
of which we have elsewhere en route seen such abundance.&nbsp; The tree
evidently, even in its large state, owes little gratitude to the sun,
at least for direct rays, none of which I should think ever reach it.&nbsp;
The Singfos however say, that it will only thrive in the shade.&nbsp;
We halted after gathering a crop of leaves under a fine Dillenia, which
was loaded with its fruit.&nbsp; Here the Singfos demonstrated the mode
in which the tea is prepared among them.&nbsp; I must premise, however,
that they use none but young leaves.&nbsp; They roasted or rather semi-roasted
the leaves in a large iron vessel, which must be quite clean, stirring
them up and rolling them in the hands during the roasting.&nbsp; When
duly roasted, they expose them to the sun for three days; some to the
dew alternately with the sun.&nbsp; It is then finally packed into bamboo
chungas, into which it is tightly rammed.&nbsp; The ground on which
it occurs is somewhat raised above the plain adjoining the village,
as we passed over two hillocks on our route to the tea, and the descent
did not evidently counterbalance the ascent.</p>
<p><i>Jan</i>. <i>17th</i>.&mdash;We arrived at Kujoo-doo this afternoon,
having passed through a great extent of jungle, which I am sorry to
say presented the usual features.&nbsp; We crossed the Deboro once during
our march, and several tributary streams which, as may be supposed,
from the size of the <i>larger</i> recipient river, are excessively
insignificant.&nbsp; The soil throughout, a good part seemed to be of
clay.&nbsp; The only plants of interest we found were two Bambus&aelig;
in flower, and two species of Meniscium, and a <i>Polypodium</i> <i>venulis</i>
tertiariis simplicibus.&nbsp; A <i>Sarcopyramis</i> <i>Soneril&aelig;</i>
was also found, but rather past flowering, and an Acrostichum? or Lomaria?&nbsp;
We did not observe any ravinules or hollows, although mounds were by
no means uncommon.</p>
<p><i>Jan</i>. <i>18th</i>.&mdash;We proceeded in a Southerly direction,
and after marching for nearly seven hours arrived at, and encamped on,
a largish plain, on which paddy had been extensively cultivated.&nbsp;
The whole route lay through a vast and deep jungle, the road running
partly on the side of an old bund: part of our road was through very
wet ground, part through rather dry elevated woods, bamboos of two species
occurred abundantly.&nbsp; We saw several vast specimens of Dipterocarpus,
one which had been cut down measured from the base to first branch 110
feet.&nbsp; Ferns still continue in excess.&nbsp; I gathered another
species of <i>Sarcopyramis</i>; a <i>Goodyera</i>, <i>Chrysobaphus</i>
<i>Roxburghii</i> in flower, but rare; and an Apostasia not in flower.</p>
<p><i>Jan</i> <i>19th</i>.&mdash;We reached Negrigam early in the forenoon
although we did not leave our ground before 10 A.M.&nbsp; The road to
the village was pretty good.&nbsp; Negrigam is a largish village on
the north bank of the Booree Dihing, which is here a considerable though
not deep stream.&nbsp; This bank is at the site of the village very
high.&nbsp; The population seemed to be considerable.&nbsp; To the south,
large ranges of hills were visible, the first of which were close enough
to admit of one&rsquo;s distinguishing them to be wooded to the top.&nbsp;
The inner ranges were lofty.&nbsp; We had some difficulty in ascertaining
where the tea was located, the accounts being rather contradictory.&nbsp;
At length we proceeded up the bed of a small river, Maumoo, which runs
into the Booree Dihing close to the village: after wading along in the
waters for two hours we arrived at a khet where we encamped.&nbsp; The
direction being from Negrigam N.W. along the banks of this stream.&nbsp;
The Pavia I first observed at Silam Mookh, was abundant, and some of
the specimens were very fine, the largest was a handsome, very shady
tree, of perhaps thirty feet high.&nbsp; The only plant of interest
was <i>Gnetum</i> <i>scandens</i>.&nbsp; On a high land bank I gathered
a species of Polytrichum, and one of Bartramia.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>20th</i>.&mdash;This morning we crossed the small
streamlet Maumoo, ascended its rather high bank, and within a few yards
from it came upon the tea: which as we advanced farther into the jungle
increased in abundance; in fact within a very few yards, several plants
might be observed.&nbsp; The plant was both in flower and ripe fruit,
in one instance the seeds had germinated while attached to the parent
shrub.&nbsp; No large trees were found, the generality being six or
seven feet high; all above this height being straggling, slender, unhandsome
shrubs: the leaves upon the whole were, I think, smaller than those
of the Kujoo plants.&nbsp; With respect to the plants with which it
is here associated, I may observe that they were nearly the same with
those of the Kujoo jungle, but here there was nevertheless one striking
difference, that the jungle was by no means so dark in consequence of
the smaller size of the jungle trees.&nbsp; The underwood consisted
chiefly of ferns, among which <i>Polipodium</i> <i>unitum</i> was very
common, and a Lycopodium.&nbsp; Bamboos occurred here and there, although
by no means so extensively as at Kujoo.</p>
<p><i>Chrysobaphus</i> <i>Roxburghii</i>, and a new <i>Dicksonia</i>,
<i>D</i>.&nbsp; <i>Griffithiana</i>, Wall. were the plants of the greatest
interest.&nbsp; With regard to the limits of the tea, it is by all accounts
of no very great extent; but this is a point upon which it is difficult
to say any thing decisive, in consequence of the thickness of the jungle.&nbsp;
The space on which we found it may be said to be an elbow of the land,
nearly surrounded by the Manmoo river, on the opposite side of which,
where we were encamped, it is reported not to grow.&nbsp; Within this
space the greater part consists of a gentle elevation or rather large
mound.&nbsp; On this it is very abundant, as likewise along its sides,
where the soil is looser, less sandy, and yellow (McClell.); along the
base of this I think it is less common, and the soil is here more sandy,
and much darker (McClell.)&nbsp; We partly ascertained that it was limited
to the west, in which direction we soon lost sight of it.&nbsp; To the
south and eastward of the elbow of land it is most common, but here
it is, as I have said above, stopped by the river.</p>
<p>The greatest diameter of the stem of any plant that I saw in this
place, might be two or three inches, certainly not more.</p>
<p><i>Nadowar</i>, <i>Feb</i>. <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Our route from this
village, at which we were encamped, to the tea locality in the neighbouring
forest, lay for the first time partly over paddy fields, the remainder
over high ground covered with the usual grasses, with here and there
a low strip; all was excessively wet.&nbsp; We next traversed a considerable
tract of tree jungle, perhaps for nearly a mile; this was a drier and
higher soil than the rice ground.&nbsp; On the northern flank of this,
and close to the edge of the jungle we came to the tea, situated on
a low strip of ground.</p>
<p>This plant here occupies an extremely limited space, and its greatest,
and indeed almost only extent, is from south to north.&nbsp; It is in
one spot excessively thick, and many of the plants had attained a considerable
size, but the largest had been cut down, when it was visited by people
from Suddiya in search of tea some short time ago.&nbsp; It had just
passed flowering; all the plants looked well, better I think than those
of Kujoo.&nbsp; The soil was very much like that of the Kujoo and Negrigam
jungles, and was remarkable for its great dryness and looseness, in
spite of the long continued and heavy rains.&nbsp; That near the surface
was dark brown, below yellow brown, and the deeper it was examined the
more yellow it seemed to become.&nbsp; We satisfied ourselves that its
depth extended lower than two feet from the surface.&nbsp; The space
the plant occupies in any numbers certainly does not exceed forty yards
in length, by twenty-five in breadth.&nbsp; About fifty yards to the
north several plants occurred, but the soil here was of a much darker
tint, although it appeared to be nearly as dry as the other.&nbsp; The
accompanying diagram may give some idea of its situation.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;We arrived at Rangagurrah, the
capital of the Muttack country, and the residence of the Burra-seena
Puttee, or Bengmara.&nbsp; Our route thither occupied us, inclusive
of the day spent in examining the tea at Noadwar, five days.&nbsp; During
the three first, we passed through a low country admirably, and almost
exclusively, adapted for rice cultivation, and consequently abounding
in wild wading birds and water-fowl.</p>
<p>As we approached Rangagurrah the ground became higher, in addition
to which it is better drained.&nbsp; We crossed about two miles from
Rangagurrah a small rivulet, a tributary of the Deboro; no plants but
one of much interest was detected <i>en</i> <i>route</i>.&nbsp; That
one was a fine forest tree affecting damp low places, apparently very
limited in extent.&nbsp; It is a new genus, belonging to Hamemelide&aelig;,
and we have called it <i>Sedgwickia</i> <i>cerasifolia</i>.&nbsp; On
our arrival at Rangagurrah we were met by the Burra-seena Puttee, &lsquo;Big
warrior,&rsquo; who escorted us to the houses he had caused to be erected
for us, and which were at a little distance from the village itself.&nbsp;
During our association with him or with his country, he was remarkably
attentive and civil, and as he is an independent man he pleased me much.&nbsp;
On the -- Feb. we reached Tingrei, a poor village about ten miles to
the S.E. of Rangagurrah, situated on the west bank of the rivulet of
the same name, another tributary of the Deboroo.&nbsp; On the same morning
as the march was very short, we proceeded to examine the tea, and the
following day was likewise given up to another examination.&nbsp; The
tea here may be characterised as dwarf, no stems that I saw exceeding
fifteen feet in height; it had just passed flowering.&nbsp; It occurs
in great abundance, and to much greater extent than in any of the places
at which we had previously examined it.&nbsp; But here it is neither
limited by peculiarity of soil or such slight elevation as the place
affords; it grows indiscriminately on the higher ground where the soil
is of a brownish yellow, and on which it attains a larger size than
elsewhere, or on clumps occurring in low raviny ground and associated
with fine bamboos.&nbsp; This ground was intersected by a very tortuous
dry nullah bed, on the banks of which tea was very abundant.&nbsp; On
either side of the jungle in which it is found, extensive clearings
occur, so that it is impossible to say what its original extent may
have been; I am inclined to think, however that its limit was with the
commencement of a small clearing running to the N.W. of a village situated
on the west bank of the Tingrei, and that not much has been cut down.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p19.jpg">
<img alt="The Himalaya from Rangagurrah" src="images/p19.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The extent may be roughly estimated as follows, reckoning from the
entrance into the jungle in a south easterly direction: the one in fact
of our route from the village to the tea.</p>
<p>S.E. 180 yards, after which it disappears, but shews itself again
sparingly about 100 yards further on, and in the same direction.</p>
<p>To the S. of this I found none, its direction being totally changed;
its general direction being now,</p>
<p>N.W. or N.N.W. in which, and in about 200 yards from the place at
which it ceased towards the south, it becomes very abundant, and continues
so in a</p>
<p>W.N.W. course for about 220 yards.</p>
<p>Thence it appears to be interrupted for the space of 80 or 100 yards.</p>
<p>It then recommences a course</p>
<p>N. by W. for about 100 yards, when it is terminated by cultivated
ground to the east, and low raviny ground to the west.</p>
<p>200 yards to the north, and close to a small village, it is very
abundant, and at least its stumps with numerous shoots, occupy almost
the whole of a small clearing bounded on the N.E. by the rivulet Tingrei.&nbsp;
It may be supposed to extend for a little distance into the contiguous
jungle to the N.W.</p>
<p>On the whole, it may be said to occupy a narrow strip of jungle,
extending from the village Tingrei in a S.E. direction about a &frac14;
of a mile.&nbsp; I consider the plants here as finer than in any of
the other tea jungles, the crown being much better developed owing at
least in some parts to the less denseness of the jungle.&nbsp; The fact
of the shoots appearing from the bases of the stems which had been cut
down in the small clearing above mentioned, gave us good opportunities
of seeing the effects of exposure to the sun.&nbsp; This they seemed
to bear well, but the shoots were rather too much elongated, and the
leaves had too much of a yellow tint to indicate that such was their
natural situation.&nbsp; No part of the soil on which tea was found
was like the soil of Nadowar or Manmoo; still, although stiffer than
the others, it was characterised by a certain lightness.</p>
<p>The superstratum was very light, and brownish black, the remainder
yellowish brown, the yellow tints as well as the stiffness increasing
downwards.&nbsp; The soil was here deeper than in any of the other sites.</p>
<p>Many parts of the ground were excessively low, and very probably
inundated during the rains.</p>
<p>From the fact of its occurring in such abundance in the small clearing
to the N.W. of the village, I am induced to suppose that it had at some
period extended down the large clearing which runs 200 yards to the
south of the above village.</p>
<p>The associated vegetation presented no peculiarities; several plants,
with which we had not previously met, occurred.&nbsp; One, a Stauntonia,
was found, which may be supposed from analogy to indicate a certain
coldness of climate.&nbsp; But on the other hand, it was associated
with so many tropical forms that not much reliance can be placed on
this isolated fact.</p>
<p>On the 25th we returned to Rangagurrah, where the elephants and dowaniers
(<i>drivers</i>) were dismissed.&nbsp; On the 26th we commenced returning
by the Deboroo, the descent of which occupied two days and a half.</p>
<p>Here let me express my opinion that in cases like ours, where a set
of men are deputed to examine countries, time spent on rivers is absolutely
thrown away.&nbsp; Of course in many instances such must be the case,
but where it is avoidable, marching, and especially returning by a different
route, should be adopted.&nbsp; Rangagurrah, be it known, is only two
days&rsquo; march from Suddiyah in a direct line, yet we have been a
month proceeding by the circuitous line of rivers between these places.</p>

<p><i>Journal</i> <i>of</i> <i>a</i> <i>trip</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i>
<i>Mishmee</i> <i>Mountains</i>, <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>Debouching</i>
<i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Lohit</i> <i>to</i> <i>about</i> <i>ten</i>
<i>miles</i> <i>East</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Ghalooms</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Lat</i>. <i>27&deg;50'</i> <i>to</i> <i>28&deg;10'</i> <i>N</i>.;

<p>I left Suddiya on the morning of the 15th October 1836, and halted
at Noa Dihing Mookh, (river mouth) a place abounding in fish, and promising
excellent sport both in fly and live-bait fishing.&nbsp; The temperature
of the Noa Dihing, an indolent stream flowing over a flat, sandy plain,
was 79&deg;; that of the B. pooter, which falls in large volume rapidly
from the mountains, was 67&deg;.&nbsp; Fish congregate in vast numbers
at the junction of rivers of different temperatures, and are there more
easily captured than in other situations, a fact that ought to be borne
in mind, whether for the mere object of sport or the more practical
purpose of fisheries in India.</p>
<p>The following day (16th) we passed Choonpoora, where the rapids commence,
and where stones first appear; one rapid, a little above Choonpoora,
is severe.&nbsp; There is a severe one also at Toranee Mookh, on which
the Copper temple is situated; and one at Tingalee Mookh, on which Lattow
is situated.&nbsp; The river now commences to be more subdivided; there
is but little sand deposited alone, but vast beds of sand and stones
occur together.&nbsp; The banks are clothed with jungle, and are occasionally
skirted with tall grasses, but the <i>churs</i> or islands disappear
it may be said with the sands, and are only formed in lower and more
distant parts from the mountains, where the velocity of the current
is less.&nbsp; Temperature at 6 A.M. 66&deg;, 4 P.M. 76&deg;, (water
of B. pooter 64.65,) 7 P.M. 72&deg;.</p>
<p>Buffaloes abundant, but I only saw a few.</p>
<p>The most interesting plants were a Cyclocodon, Liriodendron, Sanicula:
32 species were collected.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Reached Karam Mookh, about noon.&nbsp;
Rapids much increased, some very severe, especially that opposite Karam
Mookh, which we crossed without accident, although as we crossed a confluence
of two rapids, the water in the middle being much agitated; it was a
wonder that no canoes were upset.&nbsp; The bed of the river is still
more divided, the spots between the streams being for the most part
entirely composed of stones.&nbsp; The lowest temperature of the B.
pooter was 63&deg;.&nbsp; A severe but short rapid occurs at Karam Mookh
itself, the fall being very great, but the body of water small.&nbsp;
The water of this river is beautifully clear.&nbsp; Its temperature
at the Mookh 72&deg;.&nbsp; The jungle extends down to both edges of
the water, and the stream is not divided into branches.&nbsp; My guide
in the evening disgusted me by asking how many days I intended to stop
at the Koond before my return to Suddiya, when I had engaged him expressly
to go into the Mishmee hills, and not merely to Brama Koond, as the
above question implied.&nbsp; But such is the way in which our best
designs depending on native agency are often tampered with.&nbsp; Thermometer
at 8 P.M. 64&deg;.&nbsp; Species of Conaria grow abundantly on the banks!</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>18th</i>.&mdash;We are still in the Karam river.&nbsp;
Reached about noon the Kamptee village, Palampan, or rather its Ghat.&nbsp;
This Karam river is tortuous, generally shallow, with a more or less
stony bed; it is nothing more in fact than a succession of rapids, between
each of which the slope is very gentle, so that one makes good progress.&nbsp;
Temperature at 6 A.M. 66&deg; in the canoe; but in the hut in which
I slept, it is as low as 60&deg;.&nbsp; The dews are very heavy, and
the jungle, as before, comes down to the edges of the water, but scarcely
affords any marked feature.&nbsp; <i>Kydia</i> <i>calycina</i> is common,
as is likewise a large Mimoseous tree.&nbsp; There is apparently very
little diminution in the volume of water, though several minor streams
were passed between this and the Mookh.&nbsp; Liriodendron is becoming
more frequent.&nbsp; The views of the mountains are very varied; and
that of the Koond defile or Chasm, very beautiful; water-falls seem
to be distinctly visible down one hill or mountain, in particular.&nbsp;
The finest view however is on the Lohit, opposite Dyaroo Mookh, at which
place the three huge, ever snowy peaks, characteristic of the Mishmee
portion of the mountains, are distinctly seen.</p>
<p>Left the Ghat for the village which is situate on the Dea-soon or
Simaree, which flows into the Tenga-panee, and which is said now to
carry off so much water from the Karam that this river ceases a short
distance above this place to become navigable for boats like mine.&nbsp;
The path we pursued ran in a S.E. or S.S.E. direction for about a mile;
it is good, and leads through a thick jungle: the village contains probably
fifteen houses.&nbsp; The Gohain, or <i>chief</i>, is a most respectable-looking
man, and of very fair complexion.&nbsp; His people are for the most
part stout.&nbsp; The women also of very fair complexion, with their
hair tied in a large knot on the top of the head, in a peculiar way,
putting one in mind of fat Norman damsels.&nbsp; Temperature in the
boat to-day 76&deg;, the sky beautifully clear.&nbsp; The B. pooter
seems still the only river, the temperature of which is always below
that of the air.&nbsp; One interesting El&aelig;ocarpus occurred&mdash;Petal.
viridibus apice dentatis; calice griseo viridi, <i>vix</i> <i>valvato</i>.&nbsp;
I may remark, that the &aelig;stivation of Kydia is scarcely valvate.&nbsp;
I saw a, to me, new kingfisher and wood-pecker.&nbsp; The black and
white kingfisher, <i>Dalcedo</i> <i>rudus</i>, is not found on the B.
pooter beyond the termination of the sand banks.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>18th</i>&mdash;Temperature in my hut at 5&frac12;
A.M. is 56&deg;, outside it is 52&frac12;&deg;, that of the river water
63&deg;.&nbsp; We left about 8, and proceeded up the Karam, which presented
nothing singular.&nbsp; The volume of water is now less, and rapids
are more frequent: heavy snow is visible from a little above Palampan
Ghat, where the river bends to the northward; and a little further on
a fine view of the Koond occurs.&nbsp; The Chasm is bounded in the rear
by the fine rugged peak so distinctly seen from Suddiya due east.&nbsp;
About 11, we reached the Ghat, beyond which boats, except of the smallest
description, cannot pass; and about 1, started for the Mishmee village
Jing-sha, situated on the Karam.&nbsp; Our course was along the bed
of the river, and nearly due east.&nbsp; Formerly boats were able to
reach the Ghat of the village, but the water has become shallower, owing,
they say, to a larger portion being carried off by the Dea-soon, which
runs into the Tenga-panee.&nbsp; We reached the village Ghat about four
in the afternoon, but our people arrived very little before six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
The march was tedious and difficult, owing to the numerous stones which
are strewed in the way: and the necessity for crossing the river was
so frequent, that all idea of shoes was quite out of the question.&nbsp;
To increase the difficulty, the stones in the bed of river are very
slippery, and as we crossed rapids, it frequently required some care
to prevent our falling.</p>
<p>We were met by the Gam, or chief, before any signs of the village
there were visible.&nbsp; The population is small; the people fair,
but begrimed with dirt; the dress consists of a loose jacket without
sleeves.&nbsp; The primary article of clothing is indeed so scanty,
that the less one says about it the better.&nbsp; The women are decently
clothed, and have generally enormous calves, certainly bigger than those
of the men: their favourite ornament seems to be a band of silver, broadest
across their forehead, which encircles their head.&nbsp; This village
is close to the hills, and within a day&rsquo;s journey of the Koond,
at least for a Mishmee.&nbsp; One Assamese slave is among the inhabitants,
who was sold when a boy.&nbsp; A few of the men have Singfo dhaos or
swords, others miserable knives, and some the usual spear so general
with the tribes on this frontier.&nbsp; But in general the weapons of
these people are most insignificant.&nbsp; The view of the hills is
not fine from this place; it is too close to see any of great height,
and they soon disappear to the westward.&nbsp; In the evening that of
the Koond, which bears E.N.E. by N. is fine, particularly one mountain,
which is known at once by its numerous cascades or appearances of water-falls,
which, although they appear like streaks of white to the eye, are distinctly
visible through a telescope.&nbsp; The bed of the Karam is almost entirely
stony, and the immediate banks are clothed with grass.&nbsp; The jungle
is of the usual thick description.&nbsp; The Gam, whose name is Jingsha,
is a respectable looking man, fair in his dealings, and willing to oblige.&nbsp;
They all have tobacco pipes.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>19th</i>.&mdash;Halted to enable the people to bring
up the baggage, and we shall in all probability have to halt to-morrow.&nbsp;
I paid a visit to the Gam&rsquo;s house, Jingshi; it is to the S.E.
of the Ghat, and about a mile and a half distant from it.&nbsp; The
houses are all detached, and almost buried in jungle.&nbsp; Jingsha&rsquo;s
house is a good one, very long, and well built; he has only about five
skulls. <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24">{24}</a>&nbsp;
<i>Mont</i> was handed round to the Mishmees in large bamboo cups.&nbsp;
From our encampment, abundance of clearances for cultivation are visible
on the hills.&nbsp; Those to N., S., S.E. are of some extent, and belong
to a Mishmee Gam, Tapa.&nbsp; Some fine timber trees exist on the road
to the village, and a very large Ficus: no particular plants occur except
a Chloranthus, fructibus albis, which is also common towards Palampan.&nbsp;
Thermometer at noon, in imperfect shade, 83&deg;.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>20th</i>.&mdash;The temperature of the air at 5&frac12;
A.M. was 57&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp; That of water, 60&deg;.&nbsp; I was
obliged to halt again to enable the rice to be brought up.&nbsp; To-day
we gathered on the banks of the Karam, a tree in fruit, Fol. alterna,
impari-pinnata, stipulis caducis.&nbsp; Cymi compositi dichotomi; calyce
minuto, 4 dentato, reflexo; corolla coriacea, viridi, rotata; stamina
4, hypogyna, gynobasi, maxima; carpellis 4, aggregatis, 1, 3, fecundalis,
globosis, atro-cyaneis, baccatis; stylis lateralibus; semen 1, exalbumosum
arbuscula mediocris; one Chrysobalanea? one Ochnacea?</p>
<p>Yesterday they brought me a beautiful snake, Collo gracillimo, colore
pulchre fusco, maculis aterrimis, capite magno; <a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25">{25}</a>
has all the appearance of being venomous.&nbsp; To-day we passed another
place for catching fish: the water is prevented from escaping, (except
at the place where the current is naturally most violent,) by a dam
composed of bamboos, supported by triangles, from the centre of which
hang heavy stones: the fish are prevented passing down except at the
above spot, and here they are received on a platform of bamboo: the
stream is so strong through this point, that when once the fish have
passed down they are unable to return.&nbsp; One of these fish-traps
on a larger scale exists below Palampan.</p>
<p>The Karam debuts from the hills a little to the S. of east of Jingsha
Ghat: the chasm is very distinct.&nbsp; Temperature at 2 P.M. 87&deg;,
at sunset 76&deg;, 8 P.M. 68&deg;.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>21st</i>.&mdash;Left the Ghat about 9, and proceeded
over the same difficult ground down the Karam until we arrived at Laee
Mookh.&nbsp; This occupied about an hour; our course thence lay up the
Laee, which runs nearly due east.&nbsp; The bed of the river throughout
the lower part of its course is 60 or 70 yards across: the journey was
as difficult as that on the Karam.&nbsp; Towards 2 P.M. we were close
to the hills, and the river became contracted, not exceeding 30 or 40
yards across.&nbsp; It is here only that large rock masses are to be
found, but the boulders are in no case immense.&nbsp; We arrived at
the place of our encampment about 4 P.M., the porters coming up much
later.&nbsp; The march was in every respect most fatiguing.&nbsp; Temperature
about 6 A.M. 58&deg;, outside 57&deg;.&nbsp; Water 60&deg;.&nbsp; Temperature
of Laee at sunset 66&deg;.&nbsp; Of the air 71&deg;.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Cloudy: during the night we were much
annoyed by heavy gusts of wind sweeping down the river.&nbsp; Left our
encampment at 7&frac12;, and struck into the jungle, the porters still
continuing along the course of the river; after crossing some rising
ground we reached a path, which is tolerably good.&nbsp; Our course
lay about N.E.; we crossed over some low hills, and after marching for
about an hour and a quarter, came upon the Koond Chasm, or great defile;
of which, however, from the thickness of the jungle, we had no view.&nbsp;
We then descended a very steep, but not very high hill, and came upon
the Koond; of which nothing is at first seen but large masses of rock
strewed in every direction.&nbsp; We were accompanied by a number of
Jingsha Gam&rsquo;s people, and in the evening we were visited by Tapan
Gam himself, with a train of followers.&nbsp; This man assumes the sovereignty
of the Koond.&nbsp; We encamped immediately under the Faqueer&rsquo;s
Rock, which is known to the Mishmees by the name &ldquo;Taihloo Maplampoo.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The south bank is wooded to its brink, but not very densely: it is excessively
steep, and in many places almost perpendicular.&nbsp; The strata composing
it is partly limestone, lying at an angle of 45&deg;, and in many places
at a greater one.&nbsp; The scenery is picturesque and bold: on either
side of the river are hills rising abruptly to the height of a few hundred
feet, but the hills are continued longer on the north side.&nbsp; From
the Rock the river seems to run W.N.W. for a quarter of a mile, and
then bends to the S.W.&nbsp; The breadth of the bed is a good hundred
yards, but the stream at this season is confined to the fifty yards
near the south bank, the remainder being occupied by rocks in situ,
or boulders and sand: the edge of the N. bank is occupied by stunted
<i>Saccharum</i>.&nbsp; The appearance of the water is characteristic,
of a greyish green tinge, giving the impression of great depth.&nbsp;
It is only here and there that it is white with foam, its general course
being rather gentle.&nbsp; It is in various places encroached upon more
or less by the rocks forming its bed, some of which are quite perpendicular.&nbsp;
A little to the west of the Faqueer&rsquo;s Rock there is an immense
mass of rock in the bed of the river, between which and the south bank
there is now very little water and no current.&nbsp; The rocks are generally
naked; here and there they are partially clothed with Gramine&aelig;,
and a Cyperaceous-looking plant, something like an Eriophorum.&nbsp;
The river, a short distance beyond the Deo-panee, takes a bend to the
north; at the point where it bends there is a considerable rapid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p26.jpg">
<img alt="Bramakhoond and Faqueer&rsquo;s Rock" src="images/p26.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Faqueer&rsquo;s Rock itself is a loose mass of rugged outline,
about 50 feet high: access to its summit is difficult to anybody but
a Mishmee; it is, however, by no means impracticable.&nbsp; The path
by which it may be gained, leads from the eastward.&nbsp; At the summit
is an insulated, rounded, rugged mass of rock, on which the faqueers
sit.&nbsp; It is however the descent by the path to the east which is
difficult, and people generally choose another path to the west.&nbsp;
This rock is clothed with ferns epiphytical Orchide&aelig;, an Arundo,
and a few stunted trees are very common at its summit.&nbsp; Between
it and the hill is another much smaller mass, and the intervening spaces
are occupied by angular masses of rock.&nbsp; These spaces both lead
westward to that corner of the river into which the Deo-panee falls.&nbsp;
Eastward they lead to the margin of the bank.</p>
<p>The north face of the Faqueer&rsquo;s Rock is excavated into a hollow
of the Deo Dowar.&nbsp; It has no resemblance to a Gothic ruin, which
form is, I believe, peculiar to calcareous rocks.&nbsp; It is this rock
which, by its eastern extremity projecting into the water, forms the
reservoirs into which the Deo-panee falls, or rather at this season
runs; the place resembles merely a sort of bay.&nbsp; The water-mark
of floods visible on some of the rocks, is probably eight feet above
that of this time of the year.&nbsp; The reservoir is completed by a
projection from the rocks forming the south bank, but it is almost entirely
abstracted from the stream.&nbsp; The south bank immediately beyond
this is extremely precipitous, and very high.&nbsp; The Faqueer&rsquo;s
Rock is three-peaked; two peaks can only be seen from the Deo-panee,
the third is the low one to the west, the middle is the highest, and
is perforated: the eastern represents a sugar-loaf appearance.&nbsp;
Two distinct streams run into the reservoirs, the bed of one forms the
second defile before alluded to: this is very insignificant.&nbsp; The
other occupies the corner of the bay, and can only be seen from a low
station on the sand beneath: it is an attempt at a small water-fall.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;To-day I have been employed in collecting
plants.&nbsp; Nearly due east of the Koond, and at a distance of about
40 yards, the face of the hill is perpendicular, and in some places
overhanging; its extremity juts out into the stream, which here flows
with great violence; the banks are occupied by masses of rock strewed
in every direction, resulting from a landslip of great size: some of
these masses are enormous.&nbsp; The greater portion of the slip is
clothed with herbage and trees, so that it is of some age, or standing;
but in one place over the river it is clean, as if fresh formed, and
white-looking much like chalk.&nbsp; This cliff in many parts is a dripping
well, particularly in one extremity where a good deal of water falls.&nbsp;
It is clothed with the Eriophorum, which hangs down in long tufts; the
moist parts with an Adiantum much like A. C. Veneris, a beautiful Pteris,
a Pothos or Arum foliis pulchre nigro tinctis, and some mosses; B. speciosa
out of flower, and some Hepatic&aelig;, Ruta albiflora, etc.&nbsp; Between
this and the Deo-panee a small stream enters the Lohit: following this
up to some height, one arrives at a pretty water-fall; here it is inaccessible
in this direction, but by following a branch of the stream to the west,
one may arrive at the summit of the hill, from which however no view
is to be obtained.&nbsp; The summit is ridge-like, and excessively sharp;
the descent on either side almost precipitous.&nbsp; I found several
fine ferns up this hill; at its base an Acer and fine Equisetum.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p27.jpg">
<img alt="The Mori-Panee as it enters the Khoond" src="images/p27.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Koond is apparently formed by the Deo-panee and Mori-panee.&nbsp;
In the rains it must be a rather striking object, now however it is
at this season, lost amidst the fine surrounding scenery.&nbsp; How
the Faqueer&rsquo;s Rock and the rock between it and the Mori-panee
were detached, is difficult to say.&nbsp; It is evident, however, that
formerly the two rivers were not united to form the Koond as at present,
but that they had each their own channels when the Faqueer&rsquo;s Rock
must have stood between them.&nbsp; In fact both channels, in which
water has flowed, still remain.&nbsp; My broken Thermometer pointed
out the low temperature of the Lohit water, and 208&deg; was the point
at which water boiled in two experiments.&nbsp; All attempts at passing
along the river on this side would be vain, owing to a cliff which is
totally impracticable.&nbsp; The Mishmees know of no rivulet called
the Mtee; probably this has been mistaken for the Mishmee name for water,
<i>Mchee</i>.&nbsp; The way Wilcox went I am at a loss to ascertain;
as he could not have passed the Koond, he must have gone above it; although
the hills are said to be impracticable for loaded coolies.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>25th</i>.&mdash;The Koond is obviously little frequented.&nbsp;
I left sometime after the coolies, pursuing the path leading to Ghaloom&rsquo;s,
which extends to the eastward.&nbsp; An hour and a quarter brought me
again to the Laee-panee, and three hours and a half to Laee Mookh: from
this place to Jingsha Ghat is scarcely an hour&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp; The
day&rsquo;s journey occupied about five hours inclusive of stoppages:
the distance is probably about twelve miles.&nbsp; I came to the determination
of returning, owing to the known difficulty of the route pursued by
Wilcox, and the impossibility of making a collection of grain.&nbsp;
The Tapan Gam, or Lord of the Koond, particularly insisted on the impossibility
of ordinary coolies going this way, and as he offered men to bring up
grain from the plains, I at once acceded to his proposal of making a
granary in his village.&nbsp; This man had no delicacy in asking for
presents: he at once said, &ldquo;You must give gold, silver, and every
thing in the calendar of presents to the Deo,&rdquo; meaning himself.&nbsp;
As I found it impracticable to satisfy him, I sent him off with a small
present, promising more when he should have amassed the grain.&nbsp;
His brother, a tall, stout, and much more useful man, (as he does not
refuse to carry loads,) on seeing me rub salt on a bird&rsquo;s skin,
remarked, &ldquo;What poor devils we are!&nbsp; Bird&rsquo;s skins with
salt supply the Sahibs with food, while we can&rsquo;t get a morsel.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They promised to take me all over the country, and to be my slaves,
if I would point out to them where salt is to be found.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I saw nothing particular in the woods.&nbsp; I picked up the fruit
of a Magnolia and Castanea, and observed an arborescent Leea.&nbsp;
Some of the timber is fine.&nbsp; A large Acrotirchea abounds between
Laee and the Koond, as well as Chloranthus.&nbsp; Near the Laee a climber,
the base of whose stem is elephantopoid and enormous considering the
slender stem, is abundant.&nbsp; I could not get any of the leaves.&nbsp;
At the Koond, Buddleia Neemda, a Prunus, etc. occur.&nbsp; C&aelig;logyne
polleniis 4 obovatis, faciebus incumbentibus complanates materie pulverea,
mediocri.&nbsp; Dundoons are rather troublesome; they are flies, and
nearly as large as an ordinary house fly: their proboscis is large,
and leaves spots of extravasated blood where they bite, nearly of the
size of an ordinary pin&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>27th</i>.&mdash;My people brought me in a beautiful
snake, <i>Coluber</i> <i>porphyraceus</i>, ventre albo, c&aelig;terum
pulchre coccineo-badio, capite lineis nigris tribus quarum centralis
brevior, dorso lineis nigris duabus postea gradatim evanescentibus,
lineis circularibus minus conspicuis, iridibus carneis. <a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a">{29a}</a></p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>28th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday evening two elephants arrived
with grain, so that I have every prospect of being fairly on my way
in a day or two.&nbsp; Nothing worth seeing has occurred, except a man
who by some accident had the lobe of his ear torn, and had the fragments
stitched together with silver wire.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. <i>31st</i>.&mdash;Halted at the Laee-panee, and gathered
an Oberonea, and specimens of fish. <a name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b">{29b}</a></p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Dirty weather; rain looking much as
if it were going to continue for several days.&nbsp; There is a small
drupaceous fruit found here and at Beesa, the Singfo name of which is
Let-tan-shee; it is the produce of a large tree probably the fruit of
a Chrysobalanus, testibus stylo <i>laterali</i>, stam, perigynis: cotyledonibus
crispatis.&nbsp; The flavour is acid, rather pleasant, and somewhat
terebinthinaceous.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;I thought it best to set off, although
it was raining heavily.&nbsp; Our course lay in an E. direction up the
Karam for about two hours, when it diverged: it thence after passing
through some heavy jungle continued up the steep bed of the now dry
Dailoom; it next diverged again about 2 P.M., when we ascended a small
hill; it continued thence through heavy jungle chiefly bamboo, until
we descended in an oblique manner on the Laee-panee, about a mile up
which we found our halting place.&nbsp; The whole march occupied, including
a few halts, seven hours; and as the pace was pretty good for six full
hours, I compute the distance to be about fifteen miles.&nbsp; Hill
Flora recommenced in the bamboo jungle; two fine species of Impatiens
and several Urtice&aelig; making their appearance; <i>Camellia</i> <i>axillaris</i>
and some fine Acanthacea: the best plant was a species of Aristolochea.&nbsp;
The latter part of the day was fine, and the elephants with grain from
Suddiyah arrived.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Passed the forenoon in ascending the
hill opposite our encampment: it is of no great height, but like all
the others very steep.&nbsp; To the N.W. of this has occurred a large
slip, but long previous to this time; on it two or three Ph&aelig;niceous
palms may be found.&nbsp; Pandanus still occurs.&nbsp; The hill was
barren of Botany, excepting a few ferns towards base.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Left Laee-panee at 9&frac12; A.M.,
and reached the encampment at 3&frac12; P.M.&nbsp; Our course diverged
almost immediately from the last encampment, and we ascended for some
time up the bed of a torrent.&nbsp; The first hill we ascended occupied
an hour, and the remainder of the day&rsquo;s journey consisted of ascents
and descents along the most difficult path imaginable.&nbsp; All the
hills are very steep, and the paths when they wind round these, are
very difficult; a slip would cause a dangerous fall.&nbsp; About 1 P.M.
we reached two or three houses constituting a village.</p>
<p>From this, one has a fine view of the plains, and of the B. pooter
near its exit from the hills: it is much intersected by islets covered
with jungle.&nbsp; Leeches are not very numerous.&nbsp; Dundoons or
sand flies very annoying.&nbsp; I have gathered plenty of plants, especially
ferns.&nbsp; Wallichia continues; <i>Wulfenia</i> <i>obliqua</i>, and
a Companula were the best.&nbsp; At our halting place I found the fruits
of <i>Sedgwickia</i> in abundance.&nbsp; Passed two or three streams.&nbsp;
Found the flowers of a large Loranthus, or rather its very large flowers
on the ground.&nbsp; They are eaten by the natives, but the acidity
is unpleasant, owing to its being mixed with a bitter; the flowers are
two inches long: tubo 4 angulato, basi-coccinescenti, laminis viridibus
interstibus carneis, coccineo lineatis pr&aelig;senti transverse, antheris
syngenesis.&nbsp; <i>Sarcocordalis</i>, common.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Left at half-past 8, and reached extensive
<i>kheties</i> (cultivated fields) with dispersed houses at about 1
P.M.&nbsp; This place is called Dilling.&nbsp; Our route consisted of
the same fatiguing marching: we passed over some hills, from which we
had fine views.&nbsp; The first gave us a fine sight of the Patkaye
mountains, <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31">{31}</a> S.E.
of Upper Assam, which reach apparently a great height.&nbsp; The second,
of the plains of Assam.&nbsp; The exact summits of all the hills are
covered with a coarse spicate Saccharum.&nbsp; On one we met with a
Melampyracea.&nbsp; The Botany is improving greatly; two species of
Viola, two fine Cyrthandrace&aelig; occurring.&nbsp; I also noticed
Sedgwickia again, and got abundance of ferns, a Buddleia, and a fine
Amaranthacea.&nbsp; Halted on a cleared ground immediately under the
Red mountain so plainly seen from Jingsha.&nbsp; There is now no appearance
of water-falls on it, but there are several white spots owing to slips:
the brink or brim of this hill is woody, but there is a considerable
space covered only with short grass.&nbsp; The strata are inclined at
an angle of 45&deg;.&nbsp; I here got two or three fine mosses.&nbsp;
All the Mishmees have the idea, that on some hills at least rain is
caused by striking trees of a certain size with large stones, some hills
are again free from this charm; it was ridiculous to hear them call
out not to throw stones whenever we approached one of these rainy hills.&nbsp;
The people appear to get dirtier the farther we advance.&nbsp; I saw
plenty of snow on two high peaks, and had a peep of the Lohit beyond
Brahma Koond.&nbsp; Wallichia continues, as well as Bambusa, Saccharum
Megala.&nbsp; The kheties are either of rice or Cynosurus or Zea.&nbsp;
Tobacco is not cultivated, but left to take care of itself.&nbsp; Buddleia
Neemda and wild plantain continue, the latter is probably a distinct
species; leaves subtis glauco niveis.&nbsp; Pandanus continues.&nbsp;
The name of the Red mountain before alluded to, is Thu-ma-thaya, the
rivulet at its base is Tus-soo-muchee.&nbsp; Tus-soo Dee-ling is the
name of the place; a large mountain bearing N.N.E., is Sun-jong-thaya.&nbsp;
It is obvious that Dee-ling must be of some extent, as my site does
not agree with that of Wilcox.&nbsp; The view to the E. is entirely
limited to Thu-ma-thaya, and to the N.N.E., by Sun-jong-thaya; no B.
pooter is visible, nor is Ghaloom&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The snow collects
on the Thu-ma-thaya this month: the clearings for cultivation on the
declivities of Thu-ma-thaya are called Chim-bra: the houses, although
at great distances from the village, are called <i>Yeu</i>.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>6th</i>.&mdash;We arrived at our halting place after
a march of seven hours, over a most difficult and fatiguing road: we
skirted throughout the whole time the base of the huge Thu-ma-thaya;
I never saw a worse road, if road it may be called&mdash;part of it
lay over places where a false step or slip would be very dangerous,
if not fatal.&nbsp; We came suddenly on the B. pooter; but as the place
was not a good one for crossing, we prepared to go a little higher up
the stream, and though the distance we had to go was not above 100 yards,
yet as the river side was impracticable, it became necessary to ascend
and descend by a most difficult path where a slip would have precipitated
one into the river sixty or seventy feet below.&nbsp; What rendered
this passage most difficult and dangerous, was the jungle which, while
it caused you to stoop, at the same time concealed your footing.&nbsp;
It is one of the characteristics of Mishmees, that they sooner risk
their necks than take the trouble of cutting down underwood.</p>
<p>We have scarcely passed Thu-ma-thaya, so that the distance we have
travelled in a direct line from Deeling must be very small.&nbsp; The
stream of the Lohit is not forty yards broad, but the bed is about sixty.&nbsp;
It has the appearance of great depth, and roars along amidst rocks in
some places in fine style.&nbsp; I here picked up some small branches
of an elm, very like U. virgata: the tree was too late to reach fruit.&nbsp;
I also gathered a fine Acanthacea, and some good ferns.&nbsp; The north
bank of the Lohit here has the same structure as the south at the Koond,
and is perpendicular.&nbsp; The water of the Lohit is certainly much
cooler than any of the mountain streams.&nbsp; Vast blocks of rock,
of many sorts, lie strewed on the south side; one in particular is quartzose,
remarkable for the indentations on its surface.&nbsp; I here gathered
some mosses, and a good Marchantiacea, very nearly allied to Octoskepos,
but culiculate.&nbsp; Pandanus still continues, as also Marlea, Wallichia,
Caryota, and Pentaptera.&nbsp; Passed several streams, and a pretty
fall, the water falling down a cliff almost perpendicular, about 100
feet high.&nbsp; The Mishmees use the fibres and <i>reti</i> of Caryota
as an ornament to their baskets, from which it likewise keeps the rain.&nbsp;
Wild plantain continues.&nbsp; Our encampment is on a fine bed of sand.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>7th</i>.&mdash;Rain throughout the night at intervals,
and sharp cold in the morning; we left at 9 A.M. and arrived at our
encampment about 12 P.M.&nbsp; The first part of our march was very
difficult, it in fact consisted of crossing a precipice overhanging
the Lohit; the difficulty was increased by the slipperiness occasioned
by the rain; no one could pass some of the places unless aided by ratans
fixed to trees, etc.&nbsp; We came to the Sung river about 12 noon,
but were delayed some time in building a bridge.&nbsp; This river appears
to me to be in some places fordable, but the Mishmees say that it is
not; the water is beautifully clear.&nbsp; The first cane suspended
bridge occurs here; I did not fancy it, although I observed the Mishmees
cross, the passage taking barely half a minute.&nbsp; <i>Throughout</i>
<i>the</i> <i>whole</i> <i>time</i> the Mishmees use their legs and
arms, to accelerate or determine their progress; the inclination caused
by the weight is slight.&nbsp; I preferred one of our own erection,
about 100 yards distant from it.&nbsp; The height is not great over
the river, and the width is perhaps thirty yards.&nbsp; The Bourra crossed
after some delay; we were then obliged to make two halts: we followed
the Sung down to its mouth, which is barely 200 yards: its bed is rocky;
at its junction there is a large bay formed, on the N. side of which
is a fine sand bank.&nbsp; The Lohit there runs nearly N. and S., and
is excessively violent in its course, certainly ten miles an hour.&nbsp;
The scenery is pretty, but no hills of great height are seen to any
extent.&nbsp; This is the most romantic spot I have seen in my course
of travels as yet.&nbsp; We forded the bay about its centre, and encamped
on the sand: the path we are to follow is said to be above, and very
difficult.&nbsp; We here gathered some fine ferns and a Bleteoid Orchidea.&nbsp;
A Gentianacea likewise occurred.&nbsp; The Tapan Gam, on my inquiring,
said, that Wilcox passed by the upper path, the Lohit at that time running
under the cliff which forms one side of the bay. <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33">{33}</a>&nbsp;
The course of the river, he says, has since changed by the occurrence
of a large slip, principally of mica slate.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>8th</i>.&mdash;The commencement of our march to-day
was up a hill, the ascent, as in all the other cases, being very steep.&nbsp;
From its summit we could see Dilling in a horizontal distance extremely
near.&nbsp; We then proceeded skirting the hill, and descended subsequently
to the <i>O</i>. rivulet, which is of no size.&nbsp; We then ascended
another considerable height, and found ourselves on the site of Ghaloom&rsquo;s
old dwelling.&nbsp; The situation was delightful; to the N.E., a high
range was visible, which is covered with snow, the pines on the lower
parts of the ridge standing out, in fine relief.&nbsp; To the N. was
a noble peak bare at its summit, on which snow rests during some months,
its centre being prettily marked out with numerous patches of cultivation.&nbsp;
To the N. again the Tid-ding might be seen foaming along the valleys;
the hills are evidently improving in height and magnificence of scenery.&nbsp;
We reached this at 12 o&rsquo;clock, our march having lasted five hours.&nbsp;
We thence descended crossing a small stream at the base of the hill,
on which Ghaloom&rsquo;s former house stood, called the Dhaloom Basee.</p>
<p>I thence proceeded over some nasty swampy ground with a few low elevations
until we reached Ghaloom&rsquo;s, which we did about 2 P.M.&nbsp; A
small spot was allotted to us some distance from the village, on which
we erected our huts.&nbsp; Ghaloom changed his residence to this place,
owing to the death of two of his people, which was attributed to the
unhealthiness of the former site; but as might be expected from the
nature of the place he has chosen, he has suffered very severely from
fever since his removal.&nbsp; As soon as our huts were built, Ghaloom
and his brother Khosha visited us, preceded by the hind quarter of a
pig.&nbsp; Their appearance is somewhat better than the ordinary run
of Mishmees, but they are just as dirty.&nbsp; Khosha is a little man,
with a mahogany-coloured wrinkled face.&nbsp; Great attention was paid
by their attendants to all they said, and Khosha himself is evidently
the Demosthenes of the Mishmees.&nbsp; When interrupted, he commanded
silence in an authoritative way.&nbsp; Krisong was not present.&nbsp;
Khosha declares that Rooling, the Mezhoo chief, is nobody, and that
Wilcox gave him his present unknown to them.&nbsp; The acquisitions
in Botany consisted of some fine Cyrtandrace&aelig;, a Cymbidium, and
some ferns.&nbsp; One of these Cyrtandrace&aelig; is very singular:
the runners are long, producing one stem with a very small terminal
leaf, and a very large flower.&nbsp; Afterwards this leaf enlarges,
becomes a large cordate Begonioid one, bearing from its bosom apparently
one or two Siliqu&aelig;; Pandanus Bambusa continue.&nbsp; The fine
Quercus is common, <i>Megala</i>, <i>Podomolia</i>, Triumfetta, Siegesbeckia.&nbsp;
Cynoglossum, Callicarpa, Urena, Rottlera and several other low tropical
forms continue.&nbsp; The Cymbidioid has pollena 4, incumbentia postice
aliquoties minore, glandula nulla?</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Halted.&nbsp; Went to the suspension
bridge over the Lohit, which is about 60 yards across, or double the
length of the one we crossed on the 7th.&nbsp; The passage by Mishmees
takes two, or two minutes and a half, requiring continued exertion the
whole time, both by hands and feet, as above described.&nbsp; Both banks
are very steep, yet the natives are so confident of safety, that of
this bridge only one cane is trustworthy.&nbsp; Bathed in the river,
which is very cold and deep, but comparatively quiet.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>10th</i>.&mdash;Went to the Lohit, gathered Cymbidium
giganteum, two or three ferns, and a Rafflesia in its several stages.&nbsp;
I have not however yet seen the perfectly expanded flower, the natives
do not know it, although it must be a sufficiently striking object,
the alabastri before expansion are about the size of an orange.&nbsp;
Went to Ghaloom&rsquo;s house, which is of great length, built of bamboos,
raised high from the ground, divided into about twelve compartments,
and containing 100 men, women, and children.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>11th</i>.&mdash;Left for Khosha Gams; crossed the
Lohit on a raft, and left its banks at noon.&nbsp; Followed the river
for some distance, and then diverged towards the N.W. and reached Khosha
at 3 P.M., the march owing to the heat was very fatiguing.&nbsp; Found
very few plants; noticed a flower of a Ternstr&oelig;miacea nearly allied
to the genus Camellia, cor. rotat. lacin. reflexis, albis fauce carnea.
stam. 00, epipet. anther. erectis-apice dehiscent, and of a large Hibiscus;
the C&aelig;logyne of the Koond was also found.&nbsp; Two species of
Castane&aelig; occur in these woods, one with very stout thorns to its
cupula, and not eatable fruit; the other has long slender prickles,
and its fruit about the size of an acorn, is eatable, and not at all
disagreeable.&nbsp; On all the hills of any height with grassy tops
Composit&aelig; are among the most striking forms.&nbsp; Areca parva
continues, Pentaptera, and Fici continue.&nbsp; Saccharum Megala very
abundant and fine.&nbsp; Cupulifer&aelig; are becoming more abundant.&nbsp;
The roofs of the houses which are built of bamboo, are covered with
the leaves of the Marantaceous genus&mdash;capitulis densis lateralibus
<i>culmis</i> I-foliosis.&nbsp; Buddleia N&rsquo;eemda and Callicarpa
continue.</p>
<p>Want of means forms the only limit to the number of wives of a Mishmee.&nbsp;
A rich man who has at his disposal numerous cattle, etc, will give 20
<i>mithuns</i>; <a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35">{35}</a>
but the wife appears to bring with her slaves, etc. as a return.&nbsp;
A poor man will get a wife for a pig.&nbsp; Whatever the number of wives
may be, each will have a separate khetee, (field) and each khetee has
a separate granary.&nbsp; All the wives live in the same house; in fact,
one house forms the village.&nbsp; Theft is punished by a fine inflicted
by a meeting of all the Gams; if the fine is not paid, or the offender
refuses to pay, he is slain in a general attack.&nbsp; Murder is punished
in the same way, but by a heavier fine: adultery against the consent
of the husband, or at least elopement, is punished by death; if with
the consent of the husband, the delinquent is fined.&nbsp; There appears
to be no regular law of succession: the favourite son succeeding without
reference to age.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>12th</i>.&mdash;I went out for plants, and descended
to the Paeen rivulet, which is of small size: followed up its course
some way, and then returned over a low hill to Khosha&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
The guide who was some distance behind, came up with a Rafflesia bud.&nbsp;
I returned with him, and saw it to perfection; he likewise succeeded
in tracing the roots to a gigantic Cissus, the fruit of which I have
before observed is eatable, and not unlike a greengage.&nbsp; I returned
home loaded with this undescribed genus: I found likewise a fine Buddleia,
and Menispermum, with some rare Composit&aelig;, among which was an
arborescent Eupatorium and a gigantic thistle, a Prunus in flower and
fruit, and a neat Liparis, Calamus, Tree-fern, Tupistra, Pandanus, were
likewise observed, and a beautiful Viburnum, Corol sterilibus, 4 phyllis,
foliis niveis carneo venosis: petal fertil calyptratis, deciduis, intus
c&aelig;ruleo tinctis: staminibus cyaneis, ovariis pallide c&aelig;ruleis,
stigmatib. carnosis.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>13th</i>.&mdash;Opposite Khosha&rsquo;s, or rather
his granaries to the E. is a high mountain excessively steep, only partially
clothed with trees, and with stunted ones at its summit, which in December
and the colder months is covered with snow: this they call Thaya-thro.</p>
<p>Khosha positively refuses to take me any farther into the interior,
and Krisong begs that I won&rsquo;t come and see him.&nbsp; It is obvious
that they are under great fear of other tribes.&nbsp; Khosha says, he
should be attacked by all the Mishoos or Mizhoos, were he to conduct
me any farther now, and that very probably the Lamas would attack him
likewise.&nbsp; He says the only chance of success in penetrating to
Lama, is to send previously a present of salt, (about a seer) to all
the chiefs, and request their leave, without which preparatory donation,
they would cut up any messengers he might send.&nbsp; He offers to do
this at any time, and to let me know the result.&nbsp; He declined taking
me to the Chibong Gam, a few days&rsquo; journey up the Diree, although
the man is a relation of his own, and a Deboro Mishmee.&nbsp; It is
obvious that there is no chance of getting further at present, nor would
it be fair even if one could bribe them.&nbsp; He says no reliance whatever
is to be placed on Rooling, the Mizhoo who deceived Wilcox, and whom
he represents to be an underhand person.&nbsp; I tried to overcome his
scruples by assuring him that I only wanted to go as far as Rooling,
but he declines taking me.&nbsp; He says I may go any where to the west
of this, but to the north he dare not conduct me.&nbsp; I shall therefore
go to Premsong to-morrow, and if that is not a favourable place, return
forthwith to Ghaloom&rsquo;s, and thence to Deeling to botanise on Thuma-thaya.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Premsong&rsquo;s, which
we reached in less than two hours.&nbsp; Our march was in a westerly
direction across a hill of some elevation: the remainder of it was over
kheties and level ground.&nbsp; The plants evidently increase in interest
as we advance in the interior, Composit&aelig; and Labiat&aelig; being
most numerous.&nbsp; A large tree occurs not uncommonly, which is either
a Birch or a Prunus, most probably from the venation of its leaves,
the latter; the bark is exactly like that of a Birch.&nbsp; Close to
Premsong&rsquo;s I gathered a Clematis, Valerian and a fine Botrychium,
a Carex and a Cuscuta.&nbsp; The mountain on the base of which Premsong&rsquo;s
house is situated, is a very high one; it is the one that is so striking
from Ghaloom&rsquo;s old site: it is named Laimplan-thaya; its summit,
which is a high peak, is very rugged, partially clothed with vegetation,
in which, as in all the others of the same height autumnal tints are
very distinct.&nbsp; Thai-ka-thaya is a smaller peak to the S.S.W. of
Premsong&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; One of my Mishmee Dowaniers tells me that
the Mishmee (Coptis) teeta Khosha gave me last evening, is cultivated
near his native place; its flower buds are just forming and are enclosed
in ovate concave squam&aelig;.&nbsp; The leaves are of a lively green,
not unlike those of some ferns, but at once to be distinguished by the
venation; it is very evident that the Mishmees know nothing about the
period of its flowering, as they told me it flowered in the rains, at
the same time as the <i>dhak</i> flowers in Assam; the radicles are
numerous, tawny yellowish, the rhizomata are rugged tortuous, the bark
and pith are of yellow orange colour, the woody system gamboge: this
is the same in the petioles: it tinges the saliva yellow.&nbsp; It is
a pure intense bitter of some permanence, but without aroma: it is dried
over the fire, the drying being repeated three times.&nbsp; Judging
from it in its fresh state, the test of its being recently and well
dried is the permanence of the colors.&nbsp; The <i>Bee</i> flowers
during the rains: its flower, (<i>on</i> <i>dit</i>) is white and small;
they pretend that it is very dangerous to touch, causing great irritation;
both Coptis teeta, and Bee, are found on high hills on which there is
now snow; one of them, the Ummpanee or Moochee, is accessible from hence
in three days.</p>
<p>The Mishmee name for the Teeta, is <i>Yoatzhee</i>; of Bee, <i>Th&rsquo;wee</i>;
<i>Ghe</i>-<i>on</i> is the Mishmee name for the smelling root, which
the Assamese call Gertheon.&nbsp; The smell of this is a compound of
Valeriana and Pastinaca; it is decidedly aromatic, and not at all disagreeable,
it is white inside and abounds in pith, but has scarcely any taste.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I visited Khosha&rsquo;s house, which is of immense
length, and considerably longer, though not so high from the ground
as Ghaloom&rsquo;s: it is divided into upwards of twenty apartments,
on the right hand side of the passage are ranged the skulls of the cattle
Khosha has killed, including deer and pigs; on the other side are the
domestic utensils, the centre of the floor is occupied by a square earthen
space for fire-place: the bamboos, of which the floor is composed being
cut away.&nbsp; From the centre of each room over the fire-place, hangs
a square ratan sort of tray, from which they hang their meat or any
thing requiring smoke; their cooking utensils are, I believe, confined
to one square stone vessel, which appears to answer its purpose remarkably
well.&nbsp; The women appear to have no shame; they expose their breasts
openly, which from their dirty habits by no means correspond with the
exalted character of the sex.&nbsp; On hills to the N.E. of Khosha&rsquo;s
first residence, forests are very visible, descending far down the sides.</p>
<p>On an open spot a little distance from Premsong&rsquo;s, there is
a fine view of the course of the Lohit, and of the more remote (now)
snowy ranges.&nbsp; The hills beyond this exactly answer to Wilcox&rsquo;s
description, being very high, and all descending as it were unbroken
to the Lohit.</p>
<p>Went out for about two hours over a tolerably level portion of the
hill, covered with Artemesia; found abundance of interesting plants,
Crawfurdia campanulacea, a Clematis, Acer, Prunus, Camellia axillaris,
Cyathea, Myrica, Rhus, Sedgwickia, Polygala, Galium: and a beautiful
very fragrant climbing Composita.</p>
<p>Great part of the side of the hill is covered with a small hard bamboo,
which forms excellent walking sticks.&nbsp; An Urticea foliis peltatis,
was among the novelties.&nbsp; The Paeen Panee forms the nearest ravine.&nbsp;
The Polygonum, paniculis densissimis, is a certain indication of some
elevation.&nbsp; I observed Calamus, and Torenia asiatica.&nbsp; There
is likewise a large Mimoseous plant, which we found in fruit.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>15th</i>.&mdash;Spent the greater part of the day
attempting to reach the summit of Laim-planj-thaya, but my guide did
not know the way.&nbsp; We ascended for upwards of four hours, slowly
of course, but were still a long way from its summit.&nbsp; The face
of the mountain is entirely occupied by woods, with but little underwood.&nbsp;
Found abundance of plants, chiefly ferns, only saw 4 Orchide&aelig;,
of which 2 were in flower.&nbsp; The novelties were a Polygonatum, Camellia,
and Quercus lamellata.</p>
<p>I observed no less than 5 Araliace&aelig;, of which I succeeded in
getting 4: an Acer, probably that from Brahma Koond: and several <i>incert&aelig;</i>.&nbsp;
Near Premsong&rsquo;s the varnish tree was shewn to me, it is obviously
a species of Rhus.&nbsp; The Assamese name of the varnish plant is <i>Ahametta</i>
<i>Gas</i>.&nbsp; I took specimens of it in fruit.</p>
<p>They obtain the juice by ringing, and the only two specimens I observed
were evidently well drained: no preparation is required for the varnish;
and it is applied one day, the next day is hard; it has a fine polish,
and is of an intense black.&nbsp; It is the same probably with two small
trees I had previously seen in Capt. Charlton&rsquo;s garden at Suddyah.&nbsp;
Kydia continues; a fine Palm, caudex 8-10-pedali; it probably belongs
to the genus Wallichia?&nbsp; Camellia is only found towards the top;
the Polygonatum also does not descend far.&nbsp; I saw also species
of an undescribed Bucklandia, likewise one specimen which had been damaged:
the capituli pluriflori.&nbsp; Towards the middle a small bamboo becomes
plentiful; the lower joints, from which no branches proceed, are armed
with a verticillus of spines.&nbsp; I did not observe Pandanus, but
it is used for constructing large mats: Megala continues, but not up
the hill.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>16th</i>.&mdash;Attempted to ascend Laim-planj-thaya
by the Paeen rivulet which proceeds from the centre, but after proceeding
about half an hour we found our progress effectually stopped by a water-fall,
the sides of the stream being so precipitous as to render all idea of
clambering over, or proceeding round ridiculous.&nbsp; Gathered two
or three rare ferns, and a pretty Lobelia.&nbsp; On our return through
the open grassy parts near Premsong&rsquo;s, we found a fine Choripetalum
and Crawfurdia campanulacea, beautifully in flower; the flower is rose-coloured.&nbsp;
Anthistiria arundinacea, the same Sambucus found at Suddya, Solanum
10 dentatum, a Kydia and Torenia continue.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Left and returned to Khosha&rsquo;s,
as we were all out of rice, and it was impossible to get anything in
Premsong&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; The march on return occupied us about
two hours, but the path was so excessively slippery, owing to the grass
not being cut away on either side and to the dry weather and heat, that
our progress was very slow.&nbsp; Noticed Lactuca exalata and a Rottlera
on the road; more snow has fallen on the hills E.N.E.&nbsp; The descent
on returning, owing to the slippery state of the roads, was more fatiguing
than the ascent.&nbsp; Hedychium angustifolium I also observed on the
road.</p>
<p>I have as yet observed the following grains used by the Mishmees.&nbsp;
1st, Oriza, rice; variety of this called <i>Ahoo</i> <i>Da</i>; 2nd,
a species of Eleusine, <i>Bobosa</i>; 3rd, Zea Mays, <i>Gorm</i> dan;
4th, Panicum Panicula nutanti, densa clavata.&nbsp; 5th, <i>Konee</i>,
Chenapodium sp. panicula simili.</p>
<p>The Mishmee names are as follow: <i>Dan</i>-<i>khai</i> rice; <i>khai</i>
<i>hoo</i>, <i>bobosa</i>, <i>Mdo</i>.-<i>zea</i>, <i>or</i> <i>Maize</i>,
<i>Ma</i>-<i>bon</i>-<i>konee</i>-<i>yo</i> Chenopodium; <i>Thenna</i>,
a kind of Polygonum; <i>Hubra</i>-<i>Aloo</i>, <i>Ghee</i>-<i>kuchoo</i>-<i>shoom</i>,
Sweet potato; <i>Gaihwan</i>, Plantain; <i>Puhee</i> <i>Dhoonhwa</i>,
Tobacco.&nbsp; They likewise cultivate Sesamum.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>18th</i>.&mdash;Found more of the Rafflesiacea on
low hills along the Paeen; it was attached to the roots of the same
species of Cissus, on which it was found before. <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40">{40}</a>&nbsp;
I also gathered a Euonymus and a fine Engelhardtia.&nbsp; The hairs
of the fruits of Engelhardtia create a disagreeable itching.&nbsp; All
the Mishmees decline shewing me the road a foot in advance of this place.&nbsp;
I tried every way I could think of, to overcome their objections, but
to no purpose.&nbsp; They have so little regard for truth, that one
cannot rely much on what they say: I begin to think that it is all owing
to the Tapan Gam, who I suspected was insincere in his professions.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>19th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday evening Premsong arrived,
he is a man about 35, the best looking of all the Gams: but has rather
a cunning Jewish face.&nbsp; The brandy I gave him made him at first
wonderfully obliging, for he seemed disposed to enter into my views.&nbsp;
This morning however he came with Khosha and Tapan, by whom it was at
once obvious that he has been overruled; not only will he not take me
to the Lama <i>Dais</i> (plains,) but he won&rsquo;t even shew me the
road to Truesong&rsquo;s, a Digaroo, whose village is only distant about
five days&rsquo; journey.&nbsp; Premsong I know wishes to go, induced
by the promise of 200 Rs. but he is afraid of incurring the displeasure
of Khosha, etc.&nbsp; I shall therefore return towards Deeling, and
devote a few days to botanising on Thuma-thaya.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>20th</i>.&mdash;Returned to Ghaloom&rsquo;s: gathered
the Martynia, finely in flower, and observed the Rafflesiacea along
the banks of the Lohit.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>21st</i>.&mdash;Halted at Ghaloom&rsquo;s, the Rafflesiacea
is found all about, anth. bilocular, apice poro-gemino dehiscent, pollen
simplex, materie viscosa coh&aelig;renti, ovula antitropa, tegumento
unico.&nbsp; Made every arrangement with Premsong.&nbsp; According to
this Gam we are to go up the Diree, and then cross over high mountains,
leaving the Lohit entirely.&nbsp; He says the Lamas wear trowsers, socks
and shoes, and that they dress their hair <i>a</i> <i>la</i> <i>mode</i>
<i>Chinoise</i>; their houses are built on posts, and raised from the
ground: they erect forts like the Chinese, and have plenty of fire-locks.&nbsp;
They have also abundance of cattle, consisting of about seven kinds,
but no <i>Mithuns</i>; and three sorts of Horses, which alone they use
as beasts of burden.&nbsp; Their staple food is Ahoodan.&nbsp; The <i>Mithun</i>
of the Mishmees appears to me intermediate to a certain degree between
the Bison and the wild Bull; their head is very fine, and as well as
the horns that of a Bull, but their neck and body have, so to say, the
same awkward conformation as those of the buffalo.&nbsp; I have not
seen a large living one; the largest head I saw was three feet from
tip to tip of the horns, the diameter of the forehead being probably
about one-third of the above.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Returned to Loong Mockh.&nbsp; I cannot
reconcile Wilcox&rsquo;s description of Ghaloom&rsquo;s old site with
the reality, because the scenery is decidedly fine, embracing the Tidding,
and the (in comparison with the near surrounding hills) gigantic Laim-planj-thaya,
which from this presents the appearance of a vast cone with a peaked
summit.&nbsp; Premsong&rsquo;s village is obviously at a considerable
elevation.&nbsp; Found another Acrostichum, a Bolbophyllum, a rare Aristolochia
foliis palmatis, 7 lobis, subtus glaucis; sapor peracerbus, floribus
<i>siphonicis</i>.&nbsp; The Huttaya I have not seen: it occurs at a
greater distance in the mountains than I have been.&nbsp; In addition
to the plants I have gathered, Asplenium nidus it very common.&nbsp;
Tradescantia and Camelina both occur; Ricinus also occurs, the Mishmees
do not however put it to any use; Melica latifolia is common on some
of the hills.&nbsp; Anthistiria arundinacea occurs in abundance.&nbsp;
Likewise a small Areca and Chloranthus.</p>
<p>It is at Ghaloom&rsquo;s old site that these hills commence putting
on an interesting appearance, those previously seen, excepting however
Thuma-thaya, being entirely covered with tree jungle; but beyond this
site, the lower spaces unoccupied by jungle become much more numerous.&nbsp;
The Mishmee word for bitter, is <i>Khar</i>.&nbsp; Query&mdash;why should
not the name of the plant Coptis teeta, be changed to Coptis amara,
although the species of the genus Coptis are probably all bitter?&nbsp;
Sauraussa and Bombax both occur at Ghaloom&rsquo;s, as well as Pentaptera;
Sesamum is used for oil.</p>
<p>I should have mentioned the top of the hill, surmounted in going
immediately from Loong Panee towards Ghaloom&rsquo;s, is occupied almost
entirely by a species of Fraxinus.</p>
<p>On my arrival at Ghaloom&rsquo;s on the 20th, I found that the coolies
had played me the same trick as they had done previously, though not
to such an extent.&nbsp; Instead of each man having 20 days&rsquo; provisions,
scarcely one had more than 5 or 6: as they had 20 days&rsquo; given
them in addition to that they would require on the road, it is obvious
they must have thrown much away.&nbsp; Were all the Gams disposed to
take one to Lama, it could not be done with Assamese coolies and, above
all, Seerings or Ahooms are the very worst; and although often good
sized men, they are very deficient in strength.&nbsp; Nagas and Mishmees
are the best, then Kamptees.</p>
<p>I gave before leaving a packet of salt to Premsong, according I suppose
to their own custom of proceeding.&nbsp; Yesterday he went to Roomling,
Krisong&rsquo;s eldest son, and gained his consent.&nbsp; I mention
this to shew how active he is.&nbsp; He is a friend of the Dupha&rsquo;s,
<a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42">{42}</a> and to my surprise,
told me he saw Capt. Hannay at Hookhoom, who gave him a jacket, and
tried to induce him to shew him the road to Suddiya.&nbsp; He is certainly
the best of all the Gams, and appears to be very liberal.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Arrived at Deeling after a tedious
march of 8 hours: we did not traverse the two cliffs near the Lohit,
but pursued a longer, but more commodious cattle path: our Mishmees,
however, preferred the shorter one.&nbsp; Gathered Sabia, Martynioidea,
Alsophila, Menispermum at Paeen in fine flower.&nbsp; At Ghaloom&rsquo;s
old site a large Euphorbia fol obovatis, ramis 4 angulato-alatis occurs,
and Cymbydium giganteum in fine flower.&nbsp; <i>En</i> <i>route</i>
hither I noticed the following; Bauhinia, Hoya, Urtica gigas, Mucuna,
Curculigo, Panax, foliis supra-decompositis, Dalbergia, Laurus, Abroma,
Lactuca exaltata, Uncaria, Siegesbeckia, Megala, <i>Podo</i>-<i>Molee</i>,
and a species subscandent of bamboo, internodiis vix cylindricis, gracilibus;
this is of great use where it occurs, in assisting one&rsquo;s ascent
and descent.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Left about 11 for Thuma-thaya: we
first descended the Dissoo ravine, then up a very steep hill, the top
of which was cultivated, then descended and crossed another stream,
the remainder of our march consisting almost entirely of an uninterrupted
steep ascent: during our progress we gained partial views of the Plains
and the Naga Hills, but on crossing a high ridge on which I observed
Betula Populus? Rhododendrum arboreum, the view to the East and West
was very fine.&nbsp; That to the W. embracing the greater part of the
plains about Suddiya and the Abor Hills, stretching along to S.W. the
more distant Naga Hills.&nbsp; The Lohit could be traced for an immense
way, the Dihong, Dibong, Digaroo, Dihing were all partially visible.&nbsp;
To the N.E. Thegri-thaya was finely seen, then some rugged peaks among
which Laim-planj was conspicuous.&nbsp; It embraced the course of the
Lohit, at least its right bank, ridge surmounting ridge: the loftier
ones tipped with snow; and lastly it was closed by a huge wall, all
covered with snow, especially its peaks, stretching away to the N.&nbsp;
From this we descended to Yen, where, as usual, I took up my quarters
in a granary.&nbsp; During the latter portion of the journey, I gathered
a Passiflora? Lobelia two species, a Scitaminea, Spir&aelig;a, and a
curious aromatic plant, pedunculis bracte&aelig; adnatis, bracteis,
coloratis, petal videis.</p>
<p>Codonopsis, etc. Dicksonia, stipitibus atris 3 canaliculatis, frondibus
amplis, 10 pedalibus; in fine fructification; this is the same with
the Manmoo plant.&nbsp; I observed likewise an arborescent Sambucus,
a Bonnaya, a huge Begonia: Coix was seen cultivated.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>25th</i>.&mdash;Spent the day in botanising.&nbsp;
Gathered Adamia, some fine ferns, a bamboo, spiculis dense congestis,
bracteis scariosis interspersis, and Schizosfachyum, Nees ab E. etc.</p>
<p>Another and much finer species of the Fumariaceous genus, I found
on Laim-planj, Deutzia, a rare Quercus, a fine species of Antonia, (Br.)
in fruit, a Bartramia, Trematodon, Neckera, etc., noticed a fruit something
similar to that of Combretum, allis 2 maximis, 2 minimis: cotyledonibus
h&aelig;misph&aelig;ricis.</p>
<p>Saurauja, Prunus: 3 species of Aralia, Castanea, Quercus, etc.&nbsp;
A species of Panicum is here cultivated; the Assamese know it by the
name Cheena, 3 species of Polygonatum, including that from Laim-planj,
one foliis carnosis oppositis.&nbsp; 2 species of Begonia, making altogether
six.&nbsp; The Amaranthacea of Deeling is here found extensively, it
often assumes the form of a climber of considerable size.&nbsp; Musa
farinosa grows to a great size, 20 to 25 feet.&nbsp; Bambusa in flower
has stems about two inches in diameter.&nbsp; Sterculia flowers were
observed on the ground.&nbsp; In the afternoon it rained slightly.&nbsp;
This is the coldest place I have visited on these hills: in the evening
and earlier parts of the night there is a very cold draught down Thuma-thaya.</p>
<p>The Anthistiria found on the more elevated portions of these hills,
is probably different from that of the plains.&nbsp; Urticea are here
found in abundance.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>26th</i>.&mdash;This morning the atmosphere being
beautifully transparent, very high land plentifully sprinkled with snow
was visible to the N.W. by W., and to the N.W. a slight peep of the
Himalayas was gained.&nbsp; Started at 9, and commenced the ascent;
we arrived at our halting place at 11&frac12;.&nbsp; The greater part
of the march was a steep ascent through dry woods, the ground being
very slippery owing to the leaves.&nbsp; Bucklandia occurs in abundance
and of a large size, and attains a much greater height than Sedgwickia:
found many interesting plants and a small Conifera, probably an Araucaria
or a Taxus.</p>
<p>I continued the ascent until about 12, but the scene had totally
changed; the whole face of the mountain on the S. side being entirely
destitute of trees, and in many places quite naked.&nbsp; The ascent
was not very difficult, and occupied a little more than an hour.&nbsp;
This acclivity is chiefly occupied by Graminea, all past flowering,
all adhering very firmly to the rock, which is quartzose and greyish
blue outside, excessively angular: Gentiane&aelig; 2: a beautiful Campanula,
Hypericum, Viburnum, Spir&aelig;a, Bryum Neckera, Pteris, Scabiosa,
some Composit&aelig;, one or two Vaccinioidea, and a curious shrubby
Rubiacea evidently a Serissa, were observed.&nbsp; The top, which represents
a ridge, is partially wooded, the trees being the continuation or rather
termination of the jungle that covers the whole northern face of the
mountain.&nbsp; Here I saw Bucklandia, a Pomacea, Crawfurdia, Deutzia,
Cynaroidea, Viburna 2, some ferns.&nbsp; Brachymeum, Neckera, Lichens
several: a Caryophyllea and a Berberis.</p>
<p>All these were somewhat stunted.&nbsp; The various views were beautiful,
embracing a complete panorama, but unfortunately obscured towards Lama
by trees.&nbsp; The Lohit was seen extensively from the Koond to Ghaloom&rsquo;s,
and to the plains to an immense distance.&nbsp; The whole range of Abor
Hills and a great portion of the Naga, some of which appeared very high,
were likewise seen: to the S.E. high ridges not far distant and covered
with snow, limited the view; slight snow was visible on the peak seen
from Suddiya.&nbsp; The descent was very tedious owing to the excessive
slipperiness of the grass: it was dangerous, because a slip would have
frequently dashed you to pieces, and in all cases would have hurt one
severely.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>27th</i>.&mdash;Descended to Yen: near our halting
place we gathered a fine Pomacea arborea in fruit: a Symplocos, and
observed Wallichioide&aelig; and Calamus.&nbsp; The plants of the greatest
interest gathered were an Acer, an Epilobium, a Hoya grandiflora, Eurya,
Hypericum, a fine Arundo, Bucklandia: Cotoneaster microphylla, a Sabia,
Coriaria, Abelia? a rare Dipodous Orchidea of the same genus as a dwarf
plant of the Cossiya Hills.&nbsp; Rhododendron, scandesent Eleodendron.</p>
<p>The ascent for the greater part is a steep wooded ridge; the first
change indicated or induced by elevation is the diminution of the size
in the trees, and the frequent occurrence of a Betulus? out of flower.&nbsp;
Proceeding onward one comes to a ridge, the S.E. declivity of which
is nearly naked, the opposite being wooded with shrubs, Viburnum, Conaria,
Mespilus, Pomacea, Rhododendron, Rubiacea Serissa, Cupulifera and some
Composit&aelig; occur.&nbsp; Then Arbutus Vaccinium; Nardus: Filix cano-tomentosa,
Lycopodium; Dicranum atratum; one or two Hypna, a Bryum, and Neckera
fusca.&nbsp; Descending slightly from thence the ridge is observed to
be wooded on both sides; it is at the termination of this that we halted.&nbsp;
The ascent is continued up a rock, and the whole of the mountain is,
excepting the ravines, covered with Graminea, Cyperacea, Filix cano-tomentosa,
etc. but the Ericoidea are not so fine.&nbsp; The grasses of the summit
are two Andropogons: an Arundo Festucoidea, Panicum, Isachne, Nardus
ceasing below, it is towards this that Crepis? and Campanula are common.</p>
<p>The Ceratostemmata are found towards the summit, none descend any
distance, except one of Roxburgh&rsquo;s; they are all generally epiphytes.&nbsp;
Orchidea become more common towards the halting place; beyond this I
observed only two past flowering, one Habenaria, and a Malaxidea; the
others are two C&aelig;logyne, a Dipodious Orchidea, labelli ungue sigmoideo
very common, a Bolbophyllum, and a few ditto epiphytes out of flower,
one terrestrial Bletioidea is common in some places.&nbsp; At our halting
place, I observed an arborescent Araliacea, a Cissus, an Acanthacea
and a Laurinea.&nbsp; A little below, Pandanus occurs here and there,
and attains a large size, the largest in fact I have ever seen.&nbsp;
Castanea occurs about half way up, it is that species with rigid compound
spines to the cupula.&nbsp; I gathered also a fine Geastrum, but the
specimens are lost.&nbsp; Bucklandia occurs extensively; it is a distinct
species owing to its many flowered capitula; Sedgwickia comes into play
towards Yen, where Bucklandia appears to become scarce: a large Vitex
floribus roseo-purpureis is the most conspicuous tree of all, it ceases
towards the summit; Cyathea I observed only above half way.&nbsp; Camellia
axillaris occurs below, but I missed the Laim-planj plant.&nbsp; I may
here observe that almost all plants with red flowers, at least in this
quarter, are acid: the Assamese always appear to expect this, the proofs
are Loranthus, Ceratostemma, and Begonia, in which red is generally
a predominant colour.</p>
<p>Antrophyllum I noticed about Yen; towards Yen, I diverged from the
path to visit the place whence the stones are procured, which the Mishmees
use as flints for striking lights: this stone is found on the S. Western
face of the mountain: the stones or noduli are frequently sub-crystalline,
and are imbedded in a sort of micaceous frangible rock: they are very
common, of very different sizes, with glassy fracture; the best are
hard; the bad easily frangible, their weight is great.&nbsp; The inclination
of this bed is considerable; overlying it at an inclination of 45&deg;,
is the grey quartzose rock which forms the chief part, and perhaps nearly
the whole, of the mountain.&nbsp; The Mishmee name for the noduli is
<i>Mpladung</i>.</p>
<p>In the jungle at Yen occurs a huge Palm evidently Caryota, foliis
maximis supra decompositis; the diameter of the trunk is 1&frac12; to
2 feet.&nbsp; It is said to die after flowering: the natives use the
central lax structures as food.&nbsp; The Yen Gam promises to send me
specimens to-morrow.&nbsp; The Palms I have hitherto seen are Wallichia,
one or two Calami: Wallichioidia trunco 5-10 pedali, and a Ph&aelig;nicoidea,
but this I only saw at the foot of the mountains near Laee Panee, and
the small Areca common about Negrogam.&nbsp; The name of the large Palm
in Assamese is <i>Bura</i> <i>Sawar</i>.&nbsp; All the plants common
to these and the Cossiya mountains, with one or two exceptions, flower
much earlier here, those being all past flowering which I gathered in
flower on the Cossiya hills in November last.&nbsp; This is owing to
the greater cold, and the consequent necessity for the plants flowering
at an earlier and warmer period.</p>
<p>A species of ruminant, or, according to the native account, a species
of Pachydermata called the <i>Gan</i> <i>Pohoo</i>, occurs on Thuma-thaya.&nbsp;
At the summit of the mountain the ground was in one place rooted up,
the Mishmees said, by this animal, which they describe as a large Hog,
but which I should rather take to be a kind of Deer.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>28th</i>.&mdash;Returned to Deeling.&nbsp; At the
commencement of the principal descent we gathered Betula and another
Cupulifera, both moderately sized trees.&nbsp; Anthestina arundinacea,
is about this place very common, and an Andropogon, Culmis ramosis which
I had previously brought from the Abor hills.&nbsp; About half way down
by a present of <i>kanee</i> (opium), I succeeded in getting the arborescent
vitex, which is the most striking tree of all when in flower.&nbsp;
Lost sight altogether of Bucklandia, nor did I observe Sedgwickia.&nbsp;
Gathered at the foot of Thuma-thaya a C&aelig;logyne in flower, allied
to C. Gardneriana; Alsophila is common towards the base.</p>
<p>In the evening the Yen Gam came up according to his promise with
the gigantic Palm, with male inflorescence, it is a Caryota; he likewise
brought Sarcocordalis, Rafflesiacea, and a curious pubescent Piper.&nbsp;
He also added the female flowers of another Palm, which, according to
him, is another species of <i>Sawar</i>, or Caryota: the inflorescence
is of an orange yellow.&nbsp; A tree with the habit of Pterospermum
occurs on Thuma-thaya, low down Habenaria uniflora on rocks in the Dirsoo
Panee, or river; Kydia occurs about Yen, but not higher.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>29th</i>.&mdash;Reached Laee Panee after a march of
five hours; and without Assamese coolies, it might be done in three.&nbsp;
I noticed below Deeling, but still at a considerable elevation, Crawfurdia
campanu lacea, Adamea, Engelhardtia, Vitex speciosa, and Magnolia in
the order in which they are thus given, Quercus, cupulis echinatis occurs
comparatively low down, Castanea ferox still lower, Drac&aelig;na comes
into view towards the base.&nbsp; At the village first reached in the
ascent there is a Meliaceous Azedarach looking tree.</p>
<p>At our old halting place, and which is near Deeling, another <i>Ahum</i>-<i>metta</i>
<i>Ghas</i> was shewn me.&nbsp; This attains, I am told, a large size:
it is not very unlike in habit a Melanorrh&aelig;a, and its young leaves
are tinged with red, the mature ones are coriaceous.&nbsp; I have not
seen it in flower; the juice, at least from small branches, is not very
abundant, and at first is of a whitish colour; it is, <i>on</i> <i>dit</i>,
after drying that it assumes the black tint; at any rate it is excessively
acrid, for one of my servants who cut it incautiously, had his face
spoilt for a time: the swelling even after four days had elapsed was
considerable.&nbsp; With this as well as the Rhus they dye the strings
of the simple fibres of <i>Sawar</i>, which they all wear below the
knee: if not properly dried these strings cause some inflammation: the
strings are ornamental, light, and when worn in small numbers graceful,
but when dozens are employed, and all the upper ones loose, they deform
the figure much; some of the women, perhaps anxious to restrain the
protuberance of their calves, tie two or three lightly across the calf.</p>
<p>At Nohun, near Deeling, Cocoloba aculeata, <i>baccis</i> cyaneis
occurs here the same as at Mumbree in the Cossiya hills, and at Suddiya.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. <i>30th</i>.&mdash;Halted.&nbsp; Put all the grain into
the Tapan Gam&rsquo;s hands, amounting to 60 maunds.&nbsp; In the evening
received as a present a long sword from Premsong.&nbsp; Found a fine
Impatiens and a shrub coming into flower, Calyce &aelig;stiv. valvato?&nbsp;
Stamen 4, connectivo ultra antheras longe producto, ovarium adnatum,
foliis oppositis, exstipulatis.&nbsp; Meyenia coccinea, finely in flower.&nbsp;
An arborescent Urticea (B&aelig;hmeria?) foliis subtus candidis is common.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Reached the Tapan Gam&rsquo;s after
a sharp march of four hours.&nbsp; We are not yet quite at the foot
of the hills.&nbsp; Gathered <i>en</i> <i>route</i> 4 new Acanthace&aelig;,
not previously met with on this trip, among which is a beautiful Eranthemum.&nbsp;
At Laee Panee one of my people brought me a fine Aristolochia, very
nearly allied to that from Ghaloom&rsquo;s, but at once distinct by
its ferruginous pubescence, Antrophyum, and a Polypodium not before
met with were among the acquisitions.&nbsp; The Tapan Gam has behaved
very handsomely for a Mishmee, having killed a hog, and given five kuchoos
of beautiful rice, and feasted my people.&nbsp; Found two snakes, which
inhabit the inside of bamboos.&nbsp; Color superne brunneo-cinereus,
margines squamarum nigri, gula nigra, fascicula subtus antea alba, postice
lutescens.</p>
<p>Noticed Jenkinsia near Laee Panee, and some gigantic specimens of
Pentaptera, the Hool-look of the Assamese, the timber of which is used
for large canoes; and Lagerstr&aelig;mia grandiflora occurs on the banks
of the Kussin Panee.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p><i>Revisits</i> <i>the</i> <i>Tea</i> <i>Localities</i> <i>in</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Singphoo</i> <i>and</i> <i>Muttack</i> <i>Districts</i>,
<i>Upper</i> <i>Assam</i>.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Returned to Jingsha via Kussin Panee,
or river, and Karam Panee, the march being a tolerably easy one.&nbsp;
Found along the steep banks of the former a fine Meniscium, frondibus
6-8 pedalibus, and an arborescent Polypodium, caudice 12-15 pedali,
partibus novellis densissime ferrugineo-tomentosis; frondibus subtus
glauco-albidis.&nbsp; The caudex is altogether similar in structure
to that of Alsophyla, equally furnished with strong black bristly radicles
towards its base.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Left for Husa Gam&rsquo;s about 9,
and arrived at the village which is on the Kampai of the Singfos, Tup-pai
of the Mishmees about 4&frac12; P.M.&nbsp; The first part of our march
was to the E. up the Karam, we then traversed for a long way heavy jungle
in a S. direction, and then came on the dry bed of the Kampai, up which
we ascended to the village.&nbsp; Found a Ruellioidea, <i>Cyananthus</i>,
<i>mihi</i>. <i>Oom</i> of the Assamese, with which the Kamptees dye
their black blue cloths.&nbsp; Noticed an arborescent Araliacea inermis,
foliis supra decomposita; panicule patentissima.&nbsp; The Husa Gam
treated us very handsomely forming a striking contrast with the Mishmees;
he declares positively that no tea exists in this direction; I shall
therefore proceed direct from Luttora to Beesa.&nbsp; Roxburghia occurred
on the route.&nbsp; The village is on the left bank of the river: the
direction from Jingsha&rsquo;s being about N.W.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Reached Luttora after an easy march
of three hours and a half, for the most part along an excellent path.&nbsp;
We passed the following villages <i>en</i> <i>route</i> Chibong, Wakon,
Mtarm, and Mcyompsan: three of which are of some size; none however
so large as Nsas.&nbsp; This is the largest Singfo village I have seen,
and probably contains 400 people.&nbsp; This village and all the others
are situated on high ground, the ascent from the Kampai being probably
70 feet.&nbsp; The country consists of level, apparently good soil,
with here and there broadish ravines in which bamboos are abundant.&nbsp;
Cultivation is common, and of considerable extent.&nbsp; On a similar
eminence is situate Luttora, and it has been well chosen, for on both
sides that I approached it, the ascent is steep and capable of being
easily defended; the south side is bounded by the Ponlong Panee, which
runs into the Tenga Panee.&nbsp; If any ascent it is an easy one, and
must be to the westward; to the north, there is a small stream, but
neither this, Ponlong or Tenga are any thing but mere rills, which may
be easily leaped over in the dry seasons.&nbsp; Our route from Nsas
was to the W. of south.&nbsp; No stockades appear to exist in this quarter.</p>
<p>Luttora is not so large as Nsas; formerly the Luttora Gam was the
chief of all this soil, but he has been partly deserted by two bodies
of men who have respectively chosen Nsas and Htan-tsantan.</p>
<p>The Gam visited me in the evening at our halting place on the Ponlong;
he is a large, coarse, heavy-looking man, nearly blind, and excessively
dirty.&nbsp; He proposed of himself to me, to become the Company&rsquo;s
ryott in accordance with the wish, he said, of the Dupha Gam; but when
I told him he ought to send or go to the Suddiya Sahib, or Political
Agent, he said he wanted to see the Dupha first: he was accompanied
by a very loquacious oldish man, who had just returned from Hook-hoom,
to which place he had gone with the Dupha.&nbsp; They left apparently
not much pleased at my being empty handed.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Left at 6&frac12;, reached the Muttack
Panee about 8&frac12;, having come through much heavy bamboo jungle;
we then ascended the dry bed of the Muttack, and ascended after some
time the Minaboom.&nbsp; This was most tedious, as we continued along
the ridge for two hours; we then commenced our descent, but did not
reach the Meera Panee much before 1 P.M.&nbsp; Down this we came here,
and then along some curious chasms in the sandstone, and encamped about
3.&nbsp; The difference of soil between the Minaboom and the Mishmee
hills is most obvious; on the N.E. declivity there is much soil; but
on the opposite side little but rounded stones which supply the place
of soil, and in places we saw nothing but sandstone conglomerate? or
indurated soil with many boulders imbedded in it, and a blackish greasy
clay slate; while on the Mishmees, on the contrary, all is rock, hard
and harsh to the touch; or where loose stones do occur on the face of
the hills, they are all angular.&nbsp; The vegetation of sandstone is
likewise far more varied; and that of the Meera Panee district, abounds
in ferns, among which is Polypodium Wallichianum.&nbsp; The Tree-fern
of Kujing I observed in the Muttack, Sedgwickia in Minaboom, two Magnoliace&aelig;,
one bracteis persistent, induratis, and a Dipterocarpus.&nbsp; The chief
vegetation of the ridge consists of grasses, among which bamboo holds
a conspicuous place.&nbsp; A Begonia was common along the Muttack.&nbsp;
The Meera Panee would well repay a halt of two or three days.</p>
<p>At our halting place we met four Burmese, despatched by the Maum,
<a name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51">{51}</a> who has arrived
at Beesa on a visit to the Luttora Gam.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>6th</i>.&mdash;Reached Beesa after a sharp march of
six hours.&nbsp; Our course lay at first down the Meera Panee; here
I observed more of the Polypodium Wallichianum, which is common throughout
the Singfo hill country, and appears to be used as grog, at least the
juice of the petioles.&nbsp; We then diverged to the westward through
heavy jungle, and the remainder of our march consisted of uninteresting
dense jungle, water-courses, and excessively low places.&nbsp; Observed
Sabia in some of the jungles; the only interesting plants gathered were
an Impatiens and two or three Acanthace&aelig;.&nbsp; About 2&frac12;
P.M.&nbsp; we came on the Noa Dihing, which is now nearly dry, the water
having flowed into the Kamroop.&nbsp; No boat, not even a dak boat,
can come near Beesa.&nbsp; It is obvious that this river here never
presented any depth, both banks being very low; the bed consists of
small hard boulders.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>7th</i>, <i>8th</i>.&mdash;Halted at Beesa.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Started for the Naga village, at some
distance, and</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>10th</i>.&mdash;Left for Kujoo or Khoonlong, which
we reached about 1, after a march of five hours.&nbsp; At 10, we arrived
at Dhoompsan or Thoompsa, a large village with extensive cultivation.&nbsp;
The remainder of our march was through heavy jungle, many parts of which
were very low, and crowded with a fierce Calamus.&nbsp; The higher parts
abound in a Dipterocarpus, and two Castane&aelig;.&nbsp; I found many
fine ferns, all of which however we collected last year.&nbsp; Chrysobaphus,
not uncommon.&nbsp; Apostasia rare.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>11th</i>.&mdash;Visited the tea in the old locality
at Nigroo.&nbsp; No steps have been taken towards clearing the jungles,
except perhaps of tea.&nbsp; The Gam tells me, that the order for clearing
was given to Shroo, Dompshan, and Kumongyon, Gams of three villages
near the spot.&nbsp; Noticed Dicksonia <i>en</i> <i>route</i>, so that
we must have passed it last year.&nbsp; &AElig;sculus also occurs here.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>12th</i>.&mdash;Arrived at Kugoodoo after an easy
march of two hours and a half.&nbsp; At 12, went to see the tea which
lies to the S.S.W. of the village, and about ten minutes&rsquo; walk
to the W. of the path leading to Negrogam, and which for the most part
runs along an old bund road.&nbsp; After diverging from this road we
passed through some low jungle, which is always characterised by Calamus
Zalaccoideus; and then after traversing for a short time some rather
higher ground, came on the tea.&nbsp; This patch is never under water;
there is no peculiarity of vegetation connected with it.&nbsp; It runs
about N. and S. for perhaps 150 yards by 40 to 50 in breadth.&nbsp;
The Gam had cleared the jungle of all, except the larger trees and the
low <i>herbaceous</i> <i>underwood</i>, so that a <i>coup</i> <i>d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i>
was at once obtained, and gave sufficient evidence of the abundance
of the plants, many of which were of considerable size, and all bore
evidence of having been mutilated.&nbsp; They were for the most part
loaded with flowers, and are the finest I have seen in the Singfo country.&nbsp;
Young buds were very common, nor can I reconcile this with the statement
made by the Gam, that no young leaves will be obtainable for four months.&nbsp;
From the clearing, the plants are exposed to moderate sun; it is perhaps
to this that the great abundance of flowers is to be attributed.&nbsp;
The soil, now quite dry at the surface, is of a cinereous grey; about
a foot below it is brown, which passes, as you proceed, into deeper
yellow; about four feet deep, it passes into sand.&nbsp; No ravines
exist, and mounds only do about a few of the larger trees.&nbsp; The
soil as usual is light, friable, easily reduced to powder, and has a
very slight tendency to stiffness.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>13th</i>.&mdash;Left for the Muttack: our course lay
through dense jungle, principally of bamboo, and along the paths of
wild elephants; these beasts are here very common.&nbsp; We halted after
a march of seven hours on a small bank of the Deboro; the only plant
of interest was my Cyananthus in flower.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Continued through similar jungle along
the Deboro; bamboo more frequent.&nbsp; About 2 P.M. we left the undulating
hillocks, and the jungle became more open.&nbsp; At 4, we reached Muttack,
but had still to traverse a considerable distance before we halted at
Kolea Panee.&nbsp; We crossed the Deboro <i>en</i> <i>route</i>; no
particular plant was met with.&nbsp; I shot two large serpents, <i>Pythons</i>;
one 8, and the other 10 feet long.&nbsp; The Kolea Panee is of some
width, but is fordable.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>15th</i>.&mdash;After marching for about seven hours,
halted at a small village.&nbsp; The country passed over was, like most
of this part of Muttack, open, consisting of a rather high plain covered
with grasses, T. sperata, Saccharum, and Erianthus, with here and there
very swampy ravines; the soil is almost entirely sandy, light at the
surface; the yellow tint increasing with the depth, which is considerable.&nbsp;
Crossed the Deboro by a rude wooden bridge.&nbsp; I found no particular
plants <i>en</i> <i>route</i>.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>16th</i>.&mdash;Reached Rangagurrah, after a march
of about an hour: and halted for the day.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>18th</i>.&mdash;Started to visit Sedgwickia at the
wood, where we found it in February last.&nbsp; Reached the spot, which
is at least ten miles from Rangagurrah, in two hours and a half.&nbsp;
The trees had evidently not flowered last year; many of the buds were
of some size, and such contained flower buds, each capitula being in
addition enveloped in three bracte&aelig; densely beset with brown hair.&nbsp;
The natives assured me, it will flower about April, or at the sowing
of <i>halee</i>.&nbsp; When we before found it, the buds were all leaf
buds, which at once accounts for the non-appearance of flowers.&nbsp;
Gathered Sabia in the Sedgwickia wood.&nbsp; The Major <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53">{53}</a>
arrived before I got back.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>20th</i>.&mdash;Revisited the tea locality of Tingrei,
which we reached after a five hours&rsquo; march.&nbsp; The portion
of it formerly cleared is now quite clean: all the plants, and they
are very abundant, have a shrubby shady appearance; the branches being
numerous, so that the first aspect is favourable.&nbsp; But one soon
detects an evident coarseness in the leaves, the tint of which is likewise
much too yellow; altogether their appearance is totally unlike that
of teas growing in their natural shade.&nbsp; That part, and the more
extensive one which we first visited in February last, is now clearing;
almost all the large trees have been felled, and all the underwood removed.&nbsp;
The branches, etc. are piled in heaps and set fire to, much to the detriment
of the plants: all the tea trees likewise have been felled.&nbsp; My
conviction is, that the tea will not flourish in open sunshine; at any
rate, subjection to this should be gradual.&nbsp; Further, that cutting
the main stem is detrimental, not only inducing long shoots, but most
probably weakening the flavour of the leaves.&nbsp; It appears to me
to be highly desirable, that an intelligent superintendent should reside
on the spot, and that he should at least be a good practical gardener,
with some knowledge of the science also.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Reached Suddiya.&nbsp; The country
passed through was, for the first two days, of the same description
as before; i.e. rather high grassy plains with belts of jungle, and
intervening low very swampy ravines.&nbsp; The soil precisely the same
as that of the tea localities.&nbsp; The last march was, with the exception
of Chykwar, through low damp dense jungle.</p>

<p><i>Extract</i> <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>Author&rsquo;s</i> <i>letter</i>
<i>to</i> <i>Captain</i> <i>F</i>. <i>Jenkins</i>, <i>Commissioner</i>
<i>of</i> <i>Assam</i>, <i>regarding</i> <i>the</i> <i>Mishmees</i>.&nbsp;
<i>December</i>, <i>1836</i>. <a name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54">{54}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I had thus become acquainted with all the influential chiefs
near our frontier, and by all I was received in a friendly and hospitable
manner.&nbsp; In accordance with my original intentions, my attention
was in the first place directed towards ascertaining whether the tea
exists in this direction or not, and, as I have already informed you,
I have every reason to think that the plant is unknown on these hills.&nbsp;
From what I have seen of the tea on the plains, I am disposed to believe
that the comparative want of soil, due to the great inclination of all
the eminences, is an insuperable objection to its existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I before observed to you, during my stay at Jingsha, my
curiosity had been excited by reports of an incursion of a considerable
force of Lamas into the Mishmee country.&nbsp; It hence became, having
once established a footing in the country, a matter of paramount importance
to proceed farther into the interior, and, if possible, to effect a
junction with these highly interesting people; but all my attempts to
gain this point proved completely futile; no bribes, no promises would
induce any of the chiefs to give me guides, even to the first Mishmee
village belonging to the Mezhoo tribe.&nbsp; I was hence compelled to
content myself for the present, with obtaining as much information as
possible relative to the above report, and I at length succeeded in
gaining the following certainly rather meagre account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quarrel, as usual, originated about a marriage settlement
between two chiefs of the Mezhoo and Taeen tribes: it soon ended in
both parties coming to blows.&nbsp; The Mezhoo chief, ROOLING, to enable
him at once to overpower his enemies, and to strike at once at the root
of their power, called in the assistance of the Lamas.&nbsp; From this
country a force of seventy men armed with matchlocks made an invasion,
and, as was to be expected, the Taeen Mishmees were beaten at every
point and lost about twenty men.&nbsp; The affair seems to have come
to a close about September last, when the Lamas returned to their own
country.&nbsp; Where it occurred I could gain no precise information,
but it must have been several days&rsquo; journey in advance of the
villages I visited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was owing to the unsettled state of the country, resulting
from this feud, that I could gain no guides from the Digaroos, without
whose assistance in this most difficult country, I need scarcely say,
that all attempts to advance would have been made in vain.&nbsp; These
people very plausibly said, if we give you guides, who is to protect
us from the vengeance of the Mezhoos when you are gone, and who is to
insure us from a second invasion of the Lamas?&nbsp; Another thing to
be considered is, the influence even then exercised over the Mishmees
near our boundaries by the Singphos connected with the Dupha Gam; but
from the renewal of the intercourse with our frontier station, there
is every reason for believing that this influence is ere this nearly
destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives of this portion of the range are divided into
two tribes, Taeen or Digaroo and Mezhoo, these last tracing their descent
from the <i>Dibong</i> Mishmees, who are always known by the term crop-haired.&nbsp;
The Mezhoo, however, like the Taeens, preserve their hair, wearing it
generally tied in a knot on the crown of their head.&nbsp; The appearance
of both tribes is the same, but the language of the Mezhoos is very
distinct.&nbsp; They are perhaps the more powerful of the two; but their
most influential chiefs reside at a considerable distance from the lower
ranges.&nbsp; The only Mezhoos I met with are those at <i>Deeling</i>-<i>Yen</i>,
a small village opposite <i>Deeling</i>, but at a much higher elevation,
and <i>Tapan</i>.&nbsp; I need scarcely add that it was owing to the
opposition of this tribe that Captain WILCOX failed in reaching <i>Lama</i>.&nbsp;
The Digaroos are ruled by three influential chiefs, who are brothers
DRISONG, KHOSHA, and GHALOOM: of these, DRISONG is the eldest and the
most powerful, but he resides far in the interior.&nbsp; PRIMSONG is
from a distant stock, and as the three brothers mentioned above are
all passed the prime of life, there is but little doubt that he will
soon become by far the most influential chief of his tribe.&nbsp; Both
tribes appear to intermarry.&nbsp; The Mishmees are a small, active,
hardy race, with the Tartar cast of features; they are excessively dirty,
and have not the reputation of being honest, although, so far as I know,
they are belied in this respect.&nbsp; Like other hill people, they
are famous for the muscular development of their legs:&mdash;in this
last point the women have generally the inferiority.&nbsp; They have
no written language.&nbsp; Their clothing is inferior; it is, however,
made of cotton, and is of their own manufacture;&mdash;that of the men
consists of a mere jacket and an apology for a <i>dhoti</i>,&mdash;that
of the women is more copious, and at any rate quite decent: they are
very fond of ornaments, especially beads, the quantities of which they
wear is very often quite astonishing.&nbsp; They appear to me certainly
superior to the Abors, of whom, however, I have seen but few.&nbsp;
Both sexes drink liquor, but they did not seem to me to be so addicted
to it as is generally the case with hill tribes:&mdash;their usual drink
is a fermented liquor made from rice called <i>mont&rsquo;h</i>: this,
however, is far inferior to that of the Singphos, which is really a
pleasant drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Religion</i>.&nbsp; Of their religion I could get no satisfactory
information&mdash;every thing is ascribed to supernatural agency.&nbsp;
Their invocations to their deity are frequent, and seem generally to
be made with the view of filling their own stomachs with animal food.&nbsp;
They live in a very promiscuous manner, one hundred being occasionally
accommodated in a single house.&nbsp; Their laws appear to be simple,&mdash;all
grave crimes being judged by an assembly of Gams, who are on such occasions
summoned from considerable distances.&nbsp; All crimes, including murder,
are punished by fines: but if the amount is not forthcoming, the offender
is cut up by the company assembled.&nbsp; But the crime of adultery,
provided it be committed against the consent of the husband, is punished
by death; and this severity may perhaps be necessary if we take into
account the way in which they live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men always go armed with knives, Lama swords, or Singpho
<i>dhaos</i> and lances; and most of them carry cross-bows&mdash;the
arrows for these are short, made of bamboo, and on all serious occasions
are invariably poisoned with <i>bee</i>.&nbsp; When on fighting expeditions,
they use shields, made of leather, which are covered towards the centre
with the quills of the porcupine.&nbsp; Their lances are made use of
only for thrusting: the shafts are made either from the wood of the
lawn (<i>Caryota</i> <i>urens</i>) or that of another species of palm
<i>juice</i>&mdash;they are tipped with an iron spike, and are of great
use in the ascent of hills.&nbsp; The lance heads are of their own manufacture,
and of very soft iron.&nbsp; They have latterly become acquainted with
fire-arms, and the chiefs have mostly each a firelock of <i>Lama</i>
construction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With <i>Lama</i> they carry on an annual trade, which apparently
takes place on the borders of either country.&nbsp; In this case <i>mishmee</i>-<i>teeta</i>,
is the staple article of the Mishmees, and for it they obtain <i>dhaos</i>
or straight long swords of excellent metal and often of great length;
copper pots of strong, but rough make, flints and steel, or rather steel
alone, which are really very neat and good; warm woollen caps, coarse
loose parti-colored woollen cloths, huge glass beads, generally white
or blue, various kinds of cattle, in which <i>Lama</i> is represented
as abounding, and salts.&nbsp; I cannot say whether the Lamas furnish
flints with the steel implements for striking light; the stone generally
used for this purpose by the Mishmees is the nodular production from
<i>Thumathaya</i>,&mdash;and this, although rather frangible, answers
its purpose very well; with the Singphos they barter elephants&rsquo;
teeth, (these animals being found in the lower ranges,) for slaves,
dhaws, and buffaloes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Khamtees they appear to have little trade, although
there is a route to the proper country of this people along the <i>Ghaloom</i>
<i>panee</i>, or <i>Ghaloom</i> <i>Thee</i> of WILCOX&rsquo;S chart;
this route is from the great height of the hills to be crossed, only
available during the hot months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the inhabitants of the plains they carry on an annual
trade, which is now renewed after an interruption of two years, exchanging
cloths, Lama swords, spears, <i>mishmee</i>-<i>teeta</i>, <i>bee</i>,
which is in very great request, and <i>gertheana</i>, much esteemed
by the natives for its peculiar and rather pleasant smell, for money,
(to which they begin to attach great value), cloths, salt and beads:
when a sufficient sum of money is procured, they lay it out in buffaloes
and the country cattle.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p><i>Journey</i> <i>from</i> <i>Upper</i> <i>Assam</i> <i>towards</i>
<i>Hookhoom</i>, <i>Ava</i>, <i>and</i> <i>Rangoon</i>, <i>Lat</i>.
<i>27&deg;25'</i> <i>to</i> <i>16&deg;45'</i> <i>N</i>., <i>Long</i>.
<i>96&deg;</i> <i>to</i> <i>96&deg;20'</i> <i>E</i>.</p>
<p>We left Suddiya on the 7th of February 1837, and reached Kedding
on the 10th; stayed there one day, and reached Kamroop Putar, where
I found Major White and Lieut. Bigge on the 12th.&nbsp; The jungle to
this place was similar to the usual jungle of the Singpho country, very
generally low, and intersected by ravines.&nbsp; We crossed <i>en</i>
<i>route</i> the Karam river, the Noa Dihing, or Dihing branch of the
Booree Dihing, on which the Beesa&rsquo;s old village was situated;
and lastly the Kamroop.&nbsp; Kamroop Putar is close to the Naga hills;
it is a cultivated rice tract, on the river Kamroop.&nbsp; This river
is fordable, with frequent rapids.&nbsp; The only curious things about
it are the petroleum wells, which are confined to three situations.&nbsp;
The wells are most numerous towards the summits of the range; and the
place where they occur is free from shrubs.&nbsp; The petroleum is of
all colours, from green to bluish white; this last is the strongest,
partaking of the character of Naphtha, it looks like bluish or greyish
clay and water.&nbsp; The vegetation of the open places in which the
wells are found, consists of grass, Stellaria, Hypericum, Polygonum,
Cyperace&aelig;, Mazus rugosus, Plantago media, etc., all of which are
found on the plains.&nbsp; One of the wells is found on the Putar, or
cultivated ground; the petroleum in this is grey.&nbsp; The Kamroop
river above this Putar, strikes off to the eastward, and the Kamteechick,
a tributary, falls into it from the south; this last is a good deal
the smaller; the banks of the Kamroop are in many places precipitous.&nbsp;
About two miles from the Putar, a fine seam of excellent coal has been
exposed by a slip: <a name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60">{60}</a>
the beds are at an inclination of 45&deg;, and their direction is, I
think, nearly the same with that of the left bank of the river in which
they occur; immediately over the seam there is a small ravine, where
three of the veins are still farther exposed.&nbsp; Caricea, a new Dicranum,
Alsophila ferruginea, Polytrichum aloides, Bartramea subulosa, and Jungermanni&aelig;
are common near this spot.</p>
<p>Left Kamroop on the 19th, and proceeded in a S.W. direction for twelve
miles, when we halted on the Darap Kha, at the foot of the Naga hills,
opposite nearly to Beesala.&nbsp; Nothing of interest occurred.</p>
<p><i>Feb</i>. <i>21st</i>.&mdash;Commenced the ascent, and after marching
about ten miles, halted in a valley near a stream.&nbsp; Temperature
66&deg;.&nbsp; Water boiled at 210&frac12;&deg;, giving an altitude
of about 77&deg;, or 383 feet above Suddiya.&nbsp; The road was very
winding, the path good, except towards the base of the hills: the soil
sandy, in places indurated, and resting on sandstone; but there is not
yet sufficient elevation to ensure much change in vegetation.&nbsp;
Found Kaulfussia <a name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a">{61a}</a>
below in abundance, observed Castanea and a Quercus; three species of
Begonia, and three or four species of Acanthacea.&nbsp; In other respects
the jungle resembles that of the Singpho territory.&nbsp; Dicksonia
is abundant.&nbsp; Dipterocarpus of large size occurs.&nbsp; Caught
two innocuous snakes at the halting place. <a name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b">{61b}</a></p>
<p><i>Feb</i>. <i>22nd</i>.&mdash;The distance of the march is about
12 miles, and we halted after crossing the Darap Panee; some parts of
the route were difficult, at least for elephants.&nbsp; No particular
features of vegetation yet appears.&nbsp; The summit of the higher hills
looks pretty.&nbsp; Tree jungle considerable, open places with low grass,
is the surrounding feature of vegetation.&nbsp; The hill first surmounted
from the halting place is covered with a Camellia or <i>Bunfullup</i>,
(i.e. bitter tea) of the Assamese.&nbsp; The fruit has loculicidal dehiscence.&nbsp;
In habit it is like that of the tea, but the buds are covered with imbricate
scales.&nbsp; At the summit of the hill, it attained a height of 30
or 40 feet.&nbsp; Begoniacea, Urticace&aelig;, Acanthace&aelig;, Filices,
are the most common.</p>
<p><i>Feb</i>. <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Halted to enable the elephants to
come up; they arrived about 10 A.M.&nbsp; Temperature of the air 75&deg;,
water boiled at 210&deg;, altitude 1029 feet.&nbsp; The Darap is a considerable
stream, but is fordable at the heads of the rapids.&nbsp; Fish abound,
especially <i>Bookhar</i>, a kind of Barbel, <a name="citation61c"></a><a href="#footnote61c">{61c}</a>
which reaches a good size.&nbsp; Clay slate appears to be here the most
common rock, and forms in many places the very precipitous banks of
the river.&nbsp; Alsophila ferruginea, Areca, Calami, Fici., Pentaptera,
Laurine&aelig;, Myristice&aelig; continue.&nbsp; Kaulfussia assamica,
is common along the lower base of the hills.</p>
<p><i>Feb</i>. <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Started at 7, and after a march of
five hours, reached the halting place on the Kamtee-chick, some distance
above the place at which we descended to its bed.&nbsp; Distance 12
miles, direction S.S.E.; crossed one hill of considerable elevation,
certainly 1000 feet above the halting place, which we find by the temperature
of boiling water to be 1413 feet above the sea.&nbsp; The tops of these
hills continue comparatively open, and have a very pretty appearance.&nbsp;
The trees, however, have not assumed a northern character; their trunks
are covered with epiphytes.&nbsp; The Kamtee-chick is a small stream
fordable at the rapids, the extreme banks are not more than 30 or 40
yards.&nbsp; No peculiarity of vegetation as yet occurs; the fruit of
a Quercus continues common, as well as that of Castanea ferox.&nbsp;
I met with that of a Magnolia; Tree ferns, Calami, Musa, Areca, and
the usual sub-tropical trees continue; Acanthace&aelig; are most common,
Gordonea plentiful on the open places on the hills, Sauraufa two species,
Byttneria, etc. etc.&nbsp; Altogether, I am disappointed in the vegetation,
which, although rich, is not varied.&nbsp; Wallichia continues common.&nbsp;
A Begonia with pointed leaves, and a Smilacineous plant are the most
interesting, and a large Quercoid Polypodium, the lacine&aelig; of which
are deciduous; and these I found in abundance on the Mishmee hills,
although I did not succeed in getting an entire frond.</p>
<p><i>Feb</i>. <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Marched about ten miles all the way
up the bed of the Kamtee-chick, now a complete mountain stream, the
general direction being S.S.E.&nbsp; Traversed in places heavy jungle,
but for the most part we ascended the bed of the river.&nbsp; The only
very interesting plant was Podostemon, apparently Griffithianum, which
covers the rocks on the bed of the river.&nbsp; The usual plants continue,
viz. Scitamine&aelig;, Phrynium capitatum, Tradescantia, P&aelig;deria
and Isophylla, Pothos 2 or 3 species, Ixora 2, Leea, which occasionally
becomes arborescent.&nbsp; Cissus 3 or 4, Panax ditto, Pierardia sapida,
El&aelig;ocarpus, Smilax, Areca, Calami 2 or 3, Asplenium nidus, Fici
several, Pentaptera, Cupulifer&aelig;, the latter rare; Bauheni&aelig;
2, Acanthace&aelig;, one of which attains the size of a large shrub,
Guttifer&aelig; 2, Phlebochiton, Rottlera, Millingtonia simplicifolia,
Inga, Wallichia, Pentaptera, Malvacea, and Acanthacea convallari&aelig;
flore.&nbsp; I observed Pandanus to be common, (one Sterculia was yesterday
observed).&nbsp; Equiset&aelig; 2, the larger being the plant of the
plains.&nbsp; Erythrina, Lagerstr&aelig;mia grandiflora.&nbsp; Chondospermum,
Polypodium, Acrostichoides ferrugineum, and the fruit of Cedrela Toona,
Megala.&nbsp; Choranthus was not seen.</p>
<p><i>Feb</i>. <i>25th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded about 100 yards up the Kamchick,
then crossed the Tukkaka, and commenced the ascent of a high hill, certainly
1000 feet above the elevation of our last halting place on the Kamchick:
the lower portion is covered with tree jungle, the upper portion of
the mountain is open, covered with a tall Saccharum and an Andropogon,
among which are mixed several Composit&aelig;, and an Ajuga.&nbsp; Among
the grass, occur trees scattered here and there, chiefly of a Gordonia.&nbsp;
From the summit we had a pretty view of the Kamchick valley, closed
in to the S.W. by a high and distant wall, being part of the Patkaye
range.&nbsp; All the hills have the same features, but it is odd that
their highest points are thickly clothed with tree jungle.&nbsp; Observed
Kydia, Alstonia, <i>Eurya</i>, Triumfetta, Celtis, Engelhardtia, Rhus,
Rottlera, Loranthus, Callicarpa and Dicksonia all at a high elevation,
but this latter is scarce.&nbsp; No pines visible.&nbsp; <i>Dhak</i>,
Fici, Musa farinacea, Bambus&aelig; continue.&nbsp; Composit&aelig;
are common on the clearings.&nbsp; A Mimosa occurs on the summit, and
Andrachne, 3-foliata.&nbsp; Thence we descended for a short distance,
and halted at the foot of the Patkaye near the stream.</p>
<p>Direction S.S.E.&nbsp; Distance four miles.</p>
<p>Elevation 3026 feet.&nbsp; Temperature 66&deg;.&nbsp; Boiling point,
206&frac12;&deg;.</p>
<p>All the trees have a stunted appearance.</p>
<p><i>Feb</i>. <i>26th</i>.&mdash;Halted.</p>
<p><i>Feb</i>. <i>27th</i>.&mdash;To-day ascended a hill to the W. of
our camp, certainly 500 feet above it; its features are the same, Porana
alata.&nbsp; Bignonia, a Leguminous tree, a ditto Mimosa.&nbsp; Panax,
Lobelia zeylanica, Artemisia, Cordia.&nbsp; Panicum curvatum, Anthistina
arundinacea.</p>
<p>Panicum <i>plicatoides</i>, Smithea, Hypericum of the plains, and
Potentilla, Sida, and Plantago all plain plants, are found at the summit.&nbsp;
To the S.W. of our camp are the remains of a stockade, which was destroyed
by fire, it is said, last year.&nbsp; The only interesting plants gathered
were a Cyrtandracea, &AElig;schynanthus confertus mihi, a Dendrobium,
and a fine Hedychium, beautifully scented, occurring as an epiphyte.&nbsp;
Of Ficus several species are common.&nbsp; On the large mountain to
the N.E., either birch or larches are visible, their elevation being
probably 1000 feet above that of our camp.</p>
<p>The party halted until the 3rd March; I had one day&rsquo;s capital
fishing in the Kamtee-chick with a running line.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;A Havildar arrived, bearing a letter
from Dr. Bayfield, <a name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64">{64}</a>
stating that he would be with the Major in two or three days.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Capt. Hannay and I started in advance;
we crossed a low hill, then a torrent, after which we commenced a very
steep ascent.&nbsp; This ascent, with one or two exceptions, continued
the whole way to the top of the Patkaye range, which must be 1500 feet
above our halting place.&nbsp; The features continued the same.&nbsp;
The Patkaye are covered with dry tree jungle on the northern side.&nbsp;
The place, whence the descent begins, is not well defined: at first
winding through damp tree jungle.&nbsp; After a march of four hours
we descended to a small stream, the Ramyoom, which forms the British
boundary; this we followed for some distance through the wettest, rankest
jungle I ever saw: thence we ascended a low hill, and the remainder
of our march was for the most part a continued descent through dry open
tree jungle, until we again descended into the damp zone.&nbsp; We reached
water as night was setting in, and bivouacked in the bed of the stream.</p>
<p>The former vegetation continued until we reached the dry forest covering
the upper parts of the Patkaye, and here the forms indicating elevation
increased.&nbsp; Polygonatum, Ceratostemma, Bryum Sollyanum, and a Ternstr&oelig;miacea
occurred, Epiphytical orchide&aelig; are common, but were almost all
out of flower.&nbsp; Owing to the thickness of the jungle, and the height
of the trees, we could not ascertain what the trees were; but from the
absence of fruit, etc. on the ground, I am inclined to think that they
are not Cupulifer&aelig;.&nbsp; <i>Betee</i> <i>bans</i>, (of the natives)
a kind of bamboo, perhaps the same as the genus Schizostachyum, N. ab.
E. is common all over the summit, and descends to a considerable distance,
especially on the southern side.&nbsp; On this side the prevalence of
interesting forms was much more evident.&nbsp; Along the Kamyoom I gathered
an Acer, an Arbutus, a Daphne.&nbsp; Polypodium arboreum ferrugineum
was likewise here very common.&nbsp; Succulent Urtice&aelig;, Acanthace&aelig;
swarmed: a huge Calamus was likewise conspicuous.&nbsp; On this side
there is plenty of the bamboo called <i>Deo</i> <i>bans</i>, articulis
spinarum verticillis armatis, habitu B. baccifer&aelig;.&nbsp; Among
the trees on the descent, Magnoliace&aelig; occur; the petals of one
I picked up were light yellow, tinged with brown in the centre.&nbsp;
A species of Viola occurred low down.&nbsp; I believe it is V. serpens.&nbsp;
On both sides, but especially the south Ceratostemma variegatum occurs;
this is common still lower down the Kamyoom.&nbsp; The trees along this
portion of the boundary nullah, are covered with masses of pendulous
Neckera and Hypna.&nbsp; On the summit I observed two species of Panax,
a fruitescent or arbusculous Composita, Asplenum nidus, Laurine&aelig;,
etc.</p>
<p>The direction of the day&rsquo;s journey was about S.S.E.&nbsp; The
distance 15 miles.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;We reached almost immediately the
real Kamyoom, down which our route laid; we halted in its bed at 3,
after a march most fatiguing from crossing and recrossing the stream,
of about ten miles: general direction E.S.E.&nbsp; The features of this
torrent are precisely the same as those of the Kamteechick, but Sedgewickia
is common.&nbsp; I gathered a Stauntonia, Ceratostemma variegatum, and
some fine ferns, and two or three Begoniace&aelig;, Magnoliace&aelig;
three species occur, among which is Liriodendron; Cupilifer&aelig; are
common, especially Quercus cupulis lamellatis, nuce depressa; a Viburnum
likewise occurred.&nbsp; The stream is small; the banks in many places
precipitous.&nbsp; In one place great portion of the base of a hill
had been laid waste by a torrent coming apparently from the naked rocks;
trees and soil were strewed in every direction.&nbsp; Clay-slate is
common.</p>
<p>I should have mentioned that Dicksonia occurs at 4000 feet, as well
as (Camellia) <i>Bunfullup</i>, after that the former ceases.&nbsp;
The two Saurauja of Suddiya continue up to 4000 feet of elevation; on
the first ascent I observed a large Thistle, but out of flower.&nbsp;
No cultivation was passed after surmounting the first ascent; we passed
the remains of a stockade on the 4th, in which some Singphos had on
a previous inroad stockaded themselves.&nbsp; The hills are generally
covered with tree jungle, except occasionally on the north side where
they have probably at some early period, been cleared for cultivation.&nbsp;
To this may be added the curious appearance of the trees indicating
having been lopped.</p>
<p>Equisetum continues in the bed of the river.&nbsp; Nothing like a
pine was observed.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded in an E.S.E. direction towards
Kamyoom for a distance of four miles, where we met Dr. Bayfield.&nbsp;
As we found from him that it was impossible to go on, as there were
no rice coolies, etc. to be obtained, we returned to our halting place;
where I remained chiefly from supposing that the Meewoon will start
less objections when he sees that I am in his territory without coolies,
etc.&nbsp; Fished in the afternoon.&nbsp; The Bookhar, or large Barbel
already mentioned, still continues; but there is another species still
more common, of a longer form, ventral fins reddish, mouth small, nose
gibbous rough; <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66">{66}</a>
it takes a fly greedily, and is perhaps a more game fish than the other.&nbsp;
All the birds inhabiting the water-courses of the north side of the
Patkaye continue.&nbsp; Barking Deer are heard occasionally.</p>
<p>Gathered one fine Bleteoidia Orchidea, racemis erectis oblongis,
sepalis petalisque fusco-luteis, arcte reflexis, labello albido, odore
forti mellis.&nbsp; Engelhardtia occurs here, Pentaptera, Wallichia,
Calamus, Saccharum, etc.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;To-day the Meewoon arrived, accompanied
by perhaps 200 people chiefly armed with spears; he was preceded by
two gilt chattas.&nbsp; He made no objections to my remaining, and really
appeared very good-natured.&nbsp; The first thing he did, however, was
to seize a shillelagh, and thwack most heartily some of his coolies
who remained to see our conference.&nbsp; He did not stay ten minutes.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>8th</i>.&mdash;To-day I examined superficially the
ovary and young fruit of Ceratostemma variegatum, Roxb.&nbsp; The placenta
which is very green, is 5-rayed.&nbsp; The substance of the walls of
the ovary which is thick and white, projects towards the axis not only
between the lobes, but also opposite to each; so that the fruit is really
10-celled, but 5 of the cells are spurious.&nbsp; The production opposite
the placent&aelig; necessarily divides the ovula of one placenta into
two parcels, and these are they that have no adhesion with the axis.&nbsp;
At present I can say nothing about the relative site of the lobes of
the placent&aelig;, otherwise there is nothing remarkable, beyond the
production of the ovary opposite the lobes of the placent&aelig;.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>12th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday evening Bayfield returned
alone, leaving Hannay on the Patkaye, unable to come on or retreat,
owing to his having no coolies.&nbsp; It was decided, that there was
no other step left me to follow than going on to Ava, and I thus am
enabled to obey the letter of Government, relative to my going to Ava,
which reached me on the 10th by the Havildar.&nbsp; The Meewoon can
give me no assistance towards returning, although he will spare me a
few men to carry me on to Mogam.&nbsp; For the last three days I have
been indisposed.&nbsp; Altitude 2138 by the Therm.&nbsp; Temp. 208&deg;,
at which water boils.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>13th</i>.&mdash;Left and proceeded down the Kamyoom,
or properly Kam-mai-roan, according to Bayfield, in an E.S.E. direction
for about seven miles, when we reached the previous halting place of
Dr. Bayfield.&nbsp; We passed before arriving at this a small Putar
on which were some remains of old habitations; on it limes abound, and
these are a sure test of inhabitation at some previous period.</p>
<p>The vegetation continues precisely the same as that of the Namtucheek,
even to Podostemon Griffithianum, which I to-day observed for the first
time.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded on, still keeping for the
chief part of our march along the Kammiroan.&nbsp; We left this very
soon, and crossed some low hills on which the jungles presented the
same features.&nbsp; We left the village Kammiroan to our right.&nbsp;
We did not see it, but I believe it consists of only two houses.&nbsp;
Passed through one khet, the first cultivated ground we saw after leaving
that on the Kamchick; then we came on to a few more Putars, in which
limes continue abundant.&nbsp; On these I find no less than three species
of Rubus; in those parts on which rice has been cultivated a pretty
fringed Hypericum likewise occurs, and these are the most interesting
plants that have presented themselves.&nbsp; Our course improved much
yesterday; it extended E. by S., and was rather less than seven miles.&nbsp;
Halted at Kha-thung-kyoun, where the Meewoon had halted, and where the
Dupha Gam had remained some time previous.&nbsp; The same vegetation
occurs, Engelhardtia, Gleichenia <i>major</i> longe scandens, Equisetum
both species, Euphorbiacea nereifolia, Dicksonia rare, Scleria vaginis
alatis, Plantago media, Zizania ciliaris, Melastoma malabathrica, Lycium
arenarum, Duchesnia indica, Mazus rugosus, the Suddiya Viburnum, Millingtonia
pinnata, Pentaptera, Erythrina; an arboreous Eugenia fol. magnis, abovatis,
is however new, and Polypodium Wallichianum which occurred to-day growing
on clay-slate.&nbsp; But considering the elevation at which we still
remain to be tolerably high, the products both of the vegetable and
animal kingdom are comparatively uninteresting.&nbsp; There are more
epiphytical Orchide&aelig; on the south sides of these hills, than the
north.&nbsp; Musci and Hepatic&aelig; are common, but do not embrace
a great amount of species.&nbsp; Machantia asamica is common.&nbsp;
Another new tree I found is probably a Careya or Barringtonia; the young
inflorescence is nearly globular, and clothed with imbricated scales.&nbsp;
Sedgewickia has disappeared.&nbsp; No tea was seen.&nbsp; There is but
little doubt that on hills, the ranges of which rise gradually, the
acclimatization of low plants may take place to such a degree, that
such plants may be found at high elevations; can they however so far
become acclimated, as to preponderate?&nbsp; I expected of course to
find the same plants on both sides of the hills, but I did not expect
to find Rottler&aelig;, Fici, tree-ferns, etc., at an elevation of 4000
feet and upwards.</p>
<p>The fish of the streams continue the same, as well as the birds.&nbsp;
The Ouzel, white and black, long-tailed Jay, white-headed Redstart,
red-rumped ditto, all continue.&nbsp; Water Wagtails were seen to-day.&nbsp;
This bird is uncommon in hill water-courses; one snipe was seen yesterday.&nbsp;
Ooloocks (Hylobates agilis), continue as in Assam.&nbsp; With regard
to fish, both species of Barbel occur; <a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68">{68}</a>
the most killing bait for the large one, or Bookhar of the Assamese,
is the green fucus, which is common, adhering to all the stones in these
hill-streams: it is difficult to fix it on the hook.&nbsp; The line
should be a running one, and not leaded, and the bait may be thrown
as a fly.&nbsp; To it the largest fish rise most greedily; plenty of
time must be allowed them to swallow before one strikes, otherwise no
fish will be caught.&nbsp; All the same Palms continue except Calami,
Areca, and Wallichiana.</p>
<p>Balsamine&aelig; are uncommon.&nbsp; There is one however, although
rare, probably the same as the bright crimson-flowered one of the Meerep
Panee.&nbsp; Urtice&aelig; have diminished; the Suddiya Viola occurred
yesterday, the Asplenium, fronde lanceolat. continues common.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Halted.&nbsp; Water boiled 209&deg;.&nbsp;
Temp. 59 and 60&deg;.&nbsp; Elevation 1622 feet.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>15th</i>.&mdash;Left the Meewoon about 8, and proceeded
about 100 yards up the Khathing.&nbsp; Thence we struck off, and commenced
the ascent, which continued without intermission for some hours, the
whole way lying through heavy tree jungle.&nbsp; Ascent in some places
very steep.&nbsp; On reaching the summit, or nearly so, the jungle became
more open, and the route continued along the ridge.&nbsp; We then descended
for 50 feet, and halted on an open grassy spot where we ascertained
the altitude to be 5516 feet.&nbsp; Boiling point 202&deg;.&nbsp; Temperature
of the air 63&deg;.&nbsp; The vegetation increased in interest; I noticed
near the Khathing, Buddleia neemda, Pladera Justicioidea, which continues
however all along even to 5000 feet.&nbsp; Thunbergia coccinea, Chondrospermum,
Dicksonia; near and on the summit Magnoli&aelig; and two or three Cupulifer&aelig;,
Daphne Strutheoloides, nobis, Gymnostomum involutum, Berberis pinnata,
the same as the Khasiya one, but scarce.&nbsp; Laurinea arborea, Bambusa
monogynia, Rubus moluccanus: Frutex Ruscordeus, Loranthus, Anthistiria
arundinacea, Melastoma, Cyathea, Composit&aelig;, Conyzoide&aelig; two
or three, Correas one, Hedychium, Eurya, Gleichenia, Hermannia, Lycopodium
ceranium, Hoya teretifolia, Acanthace&aelig; two or three, Bucklandia.</p>
<p>We thence descended, and after a longish march reached the Natkaw
Kyown, and finally halted on the Khusse Kyown.&nbsp; During this portion
I gathered some very interesting plants, a new Ceratostemma, Adamia,
two or three Orchide&aelig;, a beautiful large flowered Cyrtandracea,
the same Daphne, an Umbellifera.&nbsp; Vaccineace&aelig;, four species
of Begoni&aelig;, a Viburnum.&nbsp; Crawfurdia and Polypodium Wallichianum,
which roofed in our shed; Musci increased as well as Succulent Urtice&aelig;
in shady places.&nbsp; Smilacin&aelig; were common, especially one at
elevations of from 3 to 5000 feet inflorescentia cernua.&nbsp; The features
are the same, the drier woods crowning the ridges.&nbsp; On the trees
of these, Orchide&aelig; and Filices are common, as well as in low parts
in which Acanthace&aelig; abound.&nbsp; I saw no <i>Betee</i>-<i>bhans</i>
nor Deo-bhans, (peculiar bamboos).&nbsp; Of the above, Ceratostemma,
Daphane, Smilacin&aelig;, Cyathea, some of the Begoni&aelig;, the large
flowered Cyrtandrace&aelig;, Umbellifer&aelig; are sure indications
of considerable elevation.&nbsp; The course was nearly south.&nbsp;
Distance about 13 miles.&nbsp; Thermometer in boiling water 206&deg;.&nbsp;
Temperature of the air 50&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp; Halting place, 3516.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>16th</i>.&mdash;Started before breakfast, and reached
the Khusee Kyoung without any material descent.&nbsp; Thence we continued
descending on the whole considerably until we reached Namthuga, at 10
A.M.&nbsp; Thence the descent increased.&nbsp; Halted on Kullack Boom.&nbsp;
General direction S.; distance 13 miles.&nbsp; Noticed Areca up to 3800
feet, as well as Cheilosandra obovata, Bletea melleodora, and Begonia
palmata as high as 3000 feet.</p>
<p>At Namthuga a Sambucus, probably S. Ebulus, a Mimosa, Pothos decursiva,
Hedychium, Urtica urens, Gleichenia major, Tradescanthia panicularis.&nbsp;
Between this and Kullack Boom Acanthace&aelig; are the most common;
P&aelig;deria triphylla appears near the Boom, together with Arum viviparum.&nbsp;
Black Pheasants were likewise heard on our route.&nbsp; On the open
halting place, grasses preponderate.&nbsp; Anthestiria arundinacea,
arbusculous Gordonia, and Saurauja, a Laurinea, Styrax, etc.&nbsp; &AElig;sculus
asamicus is common, and profusely in flower, and Pteris as on Thuma-thaya;
Musa glauca made its appearance.&nbsp; From this open space an extensive
view is obtained of Hookhoom valley, bounding which occurs a range of
hills stretching E.S.E. and W.N.W.&nbsp; These in the centre present
a gap in which a river is seen running S.&nbsp; The view to the E. is
impeded by the trees on that face of the hill.&nbsp; The valley is as
usual one mass of jungle, with here and there clear patches occurring,
especially to the W. of S., but whether from cultivation or not, I am
unable to say.&nbsp; The Namlunai river is visible; winding excessively,
especially to the E.S.E., it appears a considerable stream with much
sand: it passes out towards the gap above alluded to, winding round
the corner of the hills.</p>
<p>During the 16th, my attention was particularly directed towards Tea,
which was said positively to exist.&nbsp; I obtained some of the bitter
sort, or <i>Bunfullup</i>, but the plant which was pointed out to me
as tea certainly was not, although resembling it a good deal.&nbsp;
There is no reason for supposing, that it exists on these hills, and
if tea is brought hence, it is I should think a spurious preparation.&nbsp;
The soil is in many places yellow, in many brick-dust coloured.&nbsp;
If the Tea existed in abundance, I must have seen it.</p>
<p>The hills which confine the valley, at least those which are obvious
outliers of the Patkaye range, are characterised by conical peaks, and
there is a bluff rock of good elevation to the W.S.W. &frac12; S.</p>

<p><i>March</i> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Boiled water at 206&deg; Fahr.&nbsp;
Thermometer in the air 61&deg;.&nbsp; Elevation 3270.&nbsp; Commenced
the descent, which continued without interruption to the Loon-karankha,
where we breakfasted.&nbsp; The bed of this, which is a mere mountain
torrent, is of sandstone.&nbsp; Here Ceratostemma variegatum is very
common, and has larger, broader and more obovate leaves, than before
observed; Polypodium Wallichianum, a Begonia and Orchide&aelig; are
common on its boulders.&nbsp; Continued our course at first up a considerable
ascent, thence it was nearly an uniform descent.&nbsp; Crossed the Namtuwa,
along which our course lay for a short time.&nbsp; The latter part was
through low wet jungle, along small water-courses, till we reached the
Panglai Kha, along which we continued for some time.&nbsp; Reached our
halting place on the Namtuseek about 2 P.M.&nbsp; General direction
E.S.E.; distance about ten miles.&nbsp; Noticed Podostemon Griffithianum,
on rocks on the Namtuwa.&nbsp; My collector gathered one Daphne, Acanthus
Solanacea occurred very abundantly, corinfundib. lab super postico,
infer reflexo, laciniis bifidis.&nbsp; Low down observed the usual Dipterocarpus,
Uncaria and Kaulfussia asamica, Drac&aelig;na.&nbsp; Mesua ferrea occurred
during the first part of the march.&nbsp; Noticed the tracks of a Rhinoceros.&nbsp;
At 5 P.M. water boiled at 210&deg;.&nbsp; Temperature 69&deg;.&nbsp;
Elevation 1099 feet.</p>
<p>The most interesting plants were an Arum, an undescribed Ceratostemma,
and a Celastrinea.</p>
<p>The collection formed between this place and Suddiya now amount to
about 500 species.&nbsp; The vegetation of the lower portions is the
same, or nearly so, on either side of the hills; but I did not observe
near this the Polypodium ferrugineum arboreum, although there is a small
arborescent species of this genus.&nbsp; On either side, the lower ranges
are clothed with heavy wet tree jungle, the under-shrubs consisting
of Acanthace&aelig;, Rubiace&aelig;, Filices, Aroide&aelig;, and Urtice&aelig;;
Kaulfussia does not ascend so high on this side.&nbsp; Acanthacea solanacea
appears peculiar to this side, although there is a species of the genus
on the Kammiroan.</p>
<p>The plants indicating the greatest elevation are Acer, Ceratostemma
miniatum, and angulatum, Vacciniace&aelig;; Daphne, particularly the
Patkaye one, and D. struthioloides, most of the Smilacine&aelig;, Berberis,
etc. etc.&nbsp; Bucklandia Crawfurdii, Begoni&aelig;, some Viburnia,
Cyathea, etc. of Ceratostemma (Gay Lussacium?) several, perhaps not
less than seven species occur; all have the same habit, and the same
depot of nourishment in the thick portion near the <i>collet</i>.&nbsp;
No Conifer&aelig; exist, although the elevation is more than sufficient
to determine their appearance.&nbsp; In Orchide&aelig; the flora is
certainly very rich, but few species are in flower</p>
<p>(<i>Memo</i>.&nbsp; To compare these elevational plants with those
from the Mishmee hills, on which, speaking from memory, they are more
abundant.)</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>18th</i>.&mdash;Left at half-past 6, and arrived
(after halting about one hour and a half) at 3 P.M.&nbsp; The road was
very circuitous, for the first part E. by S., subsequently for some
time N.N.E., and even N.E.; the general direction is perhaps E.; the
distance certainly 18 miles.&nbsp; The greater part of the route lay
through heavy but dryish tree jungle; but during the latter half, and
especially towards Nempean, Putars or cultivated fields increased in
number, and extent.&nbsp; We crossed one stream only.&nbsp; The soil
is yellow and deep, occasionally inclining to brick-red; it is apparently
much the same as that of Muttack.&nbsp; The low spots were uncommon.&nbsp;
We saw only two paths diverging from ours; one of these led to Bone,
which is about two miles from our path, in a south direction, and at
no great distance from the Namtuseek.</p>
<p>The features of the country and its productions are much the same
as those of Upper Assam, indeed strikingly so.&nbsp; During the earlier
part of our march we observed a fine Shorea in abundance; it had a noble
straight stem, but the leaves were too small for Saul.&nbsp; The only
new plants I found were Styrax floribus odoris, ligno albo close grained,
arbor mediocris, a B&aelig;obotrys, two Goodyer&aelig;, a Laurinea,
Sparganium!&nbsp; Tabern&aelig;montana fructibus magnis, edulibus, fol.
obovatis, and a species of Shorea.</p>
<p>I noticed the following plants in the following order from Namtuseek:
Dicksonia, Areca, Calamus, Bambusa, speculis pubescentibus, deformatis,
a species of Phrynium, Pladera justicioides, Chrysobaphus Roxburghii,
Phyllanthus, Embilica, a species of Wendlandia common in places that
appeared to have been formerly cleared; Gnetum lepidotum, Celastrinea
<i>foliis</i> <i>Leguminosarum</i>, Bombax (inerme) Saccharum Megala,
Imperata cylindica, Anthistiria arundinacea, Ing&aelig; sp., Saurauj&aelig;
sp.&nbsp; Entada, Gleichenia, Hermannia, Blechnum orientale, B&aelig;obotrys,
Meniscium 3-phyllum, Sonerila, Acanthus leucostachys, Diplazium of Kujoo,
<i>Podomolee</i>, Saccharum foliis apice spiraliter tortis, Osbeckia,
Rottlera, Lygodium, Rubus moluccanus, Centotheca, Zizania ciliaris,
Viola asamica, Potamogeton nutans, foliis linearibus, Limnophila, Pontederia
dilatata, Lobelia Zeylanica, Hypericum venustum.&nbsp; Panax foliis
supra decompositis spinosis, Callicarp&aelig; 2 spec, Duchesnea indica,
Combretum, Melica latifolia, Magus rugosus, Vandellia peduncularis,
Villarsia pumila, Artocarpus integrifolius, Piper, Lagerstr&aelig;mia
grandiflora, Roxb. Dillenia speciosa, Spathodea.&nbsp; All these exist
in Assam.</p>
<p>The birds are the same.&nbsp; As for instance, common Maina, Doves,
the Picus of low swampy places, and the <i>Lark</i> of the plains of
Assam.&nbsp; Squirrel, ventre ferrugineo.&nbsp; Black Pheasant, <i>Phasianus</i>
<i>leucomelanus</i>, Laurine&aelig;, Acanthace&aelig;, Rubiacea and
Filices, are common in the jungles.</p>
<p>The Putars are clothed with the same grasses as in Assam.&nbsp; Imperata
cylindrica, Anthistiria arundinacea, Megala in low places with Alpinea
Allughas, in those lately under cultivation, the Campanula of the B.
pooter occurs, together with Hypericum, Gnaphalium, Poa and Carex.</p>
<p>From the frequent occurrence of these Putars, I should say that the
capabilities of the country, at least the latter half of our march,
improves as far as regards <i>halee</i> cultivation.</p>
<p>Throughout the march nothing occurred to shew that this part of the
valley is inhabited.&nbsp; We passed, however, an old and extensive
burying ground of the Singphos.&nbsp; Of the Putars only small portions
were cultivated, and the crops did not appear to be very good.</p>
<p>Nempean, which is a stockaded village, is about a quarter of a mile
from the encampment of the Meewoon, and about S.E., and within 200 yards
to the N.N.E. is a similar stockaded village called Tubone.&nbsp; Both
these villages are on the right bank of the Namturoon, which is a large
stream, as big nearly as the Noa Dihing at Beesa.&nbsp; B. measured
it, and finds its extreme bed to be 270 yards broad.&nbsp; The volume
of water is considerable, the rapids are moderate; it is navigable for
largish canoes.&nbsp; On this bank, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. right, there
is an extensive plain running nearly N. and S.; no part of it seems
to be cultivated.&nbsp; The scenery is precisely the same as that of
Upper Assam, viz. open, flat, intersected by belts of jungle.&nbsp;
With the exception of the W. and the points between this and south,
hills are visible, some of considerable height.&nbsp; To the S.E. there
is a fine peak, which reminds one much of the Mishmee peak, so remarkable
at Suddiya.&nbsp; It is in this direction that the hills are highest.</p>
<p>No tea is reported to exist here.&nbsp; B. met with it on his road
hither, and shewed me the specimen; there is no difference between this
and the Assam specimens in appearance, neither are the leaves at all
smaller.&nbsp; As a new route has been cut out I cannot visit it, but
shall wait until I arrive at Meinkhoom.</p>
<p>The Chykwar Mulberry occurs, and to a larger size than I have seen
it in Assam.&nbsp; The Singphos, however, as they have no silkworms,
do not make use of it; I have seen some little cultivation on the Tooroon
belonging to Bon: Kanee or Opium formed portion of it.</p>
<p>Thermometer in shade at 2 P.M. 85&deg;.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>21st</i>.&mdash;7 A.M.&nbsp; Thermometer 60&deg;.&nbsp;
Yesterday at 2 P.M. 86&deg;! under a decently covered shed.</p>
<p>Boiled water at 209&frac12; Fahr.&nbsp; Thermometer 70&deg;, which
gives 1399 feet of elevation.</p>
<p>Started at 9, and arrived at Kidding on the Saxsai, a small stream
which now falls into the Tooroon.&nbsp; Distance about four miles and
a half from Nempean: general direction about S.S.E.&nbsp; The road runs
along the Tooroon S., and a little to the W. of S.; it then diverges
up the Saxsai, which runs nearly W. and E.&nbsp; Near the mouth of the
Saxsai, and about 400 yards above, there is another small stream, the
Jinnip Kha.&nbsp; Both these are on the left bank of the river.&nbsp;
On the opposite side, and about a quarter of a mile, is a village, which
like all the rest is stockaded.&nbsp; Kidding is larger than either
Tubone or Nempean; it is on the left bank of the Saxsai.&nbsp; Rapids
are common in the Tooroon, but are not of any severity.</p>
<p>The vegetation remains in a remarkable degree similar to that of
Assam.&nbsp; The Lohit Campanula is very common in the stony beds of
either river.</p>
<p>Brahminy Ducks seen at Nempean, and the ravenous Geese of Kamroop
Putar.&nbsp; Fished in the Tooroon, and had excellent sport, killing
in the afternoon twenty fishes, average weight half pound; some weighing
nearly two pounds.&nbsp; Three species occurred, and all were taken
with flies; the smallest are a good deal like the <i>Boal</i> of Assam.&nbsp;
The large-mouthed, trout-like Cyprinida <a name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a">{74a}</a>
occurs, and to a larger size than in the Noa Dihing.&nbsp; The third
is the <i>Chikrum</i> of the Singphos; it is a thick, very powerful
fish, a good deal resembling the Roach: one of two pounds, measures
about a foot in length.&nbsp; Outline ovate lanceolate, head small,
mouth with four filaments; eyes very large, fins reddish, first ray
of the dorsal large spinous.&nbsp; It affects deep water, particularly
at the edges of the streams running into such places. <a name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b">{74b}</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It takes a fly greedily even in quite still water; but as it has a small
mouth, the smaller the flies the better.&nbsp; Black hackle is better
for it than small grey midges.&nbsp; On being hooked it rushes off with
violence, frequently leaping out of the water.&nbsp; It is a much more
game fish than the Bookhar: the largest I took with flies; with worms
I took only one small one.&nbsp; With regard to the Bookhar, it is strange
if it is not found in the streams running through this valley, as in
the Kammaroan it occurs in abundance.</p>
<p>Black and white Kingfisher, <i>Alcedo</i> <i>rudis</i>, Snippets,
Curlews of the B. pooter, with chesnutish back occur in the valley,
together with Toucans: and Ravens occur as in Assam.</p>
<p>At the village of Kidding there are silkworms fed.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Started at 6 P.M., reached Shelling
khet on the Prong Prongkha in about two hours; it is distant about seven
miles.&nbsp; The village is now deserted.&nbsp; The nullah is small,
with a very slow stream; direction from Kidding nearly S.E.&nbsp; It
was at this place that Bayfield got his specimen of tea, but on enquiry
we found that it was brought from some distance; it is said to grow
on a low range of hills.&nbsp; We started after breakfast, and reached
Culleyang, on the same nullah, about 12 o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Total distance
thirteen miles; direction S.S.E.&nbsp; Path very winding.&nbsp; The
country traversed is much less open than that of Nempean, but few Putars
occurred; and the whole tract is covered either with tree or Megala
jungle.&nbsp; Water boiled at Shelling khet at 209&frac12; Fahr.&nbsp;
Temp. of the air 68&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp; Elevation 1340 feet.&nbsp; Noticed
but very little clearing for cultivation, neither did the Putars appear
to have been lately under cultivation.</p>
<p>Culleyang is a village containing about eight houses; it is not stockaded,
and has the usual slovenly appearance of Singpho villages.&nbsp; The
natives keep silkworms, which they feed on the Chykwar or Assam morus,
which they cultivate.&nbsp; I noticed likewise Kanee, or Opium, and
Urtica nivea, which they use for nets; Acanthace&aelig;, Indigofera,
and Peach trees.</p>
<p>Close to the village are the burying places of two Singphos.&nbsp;
These have the usual structure of the cemeteries of the tribe, the graves
being covered by a high conical thatched roof.&nbsp; I find from Bayfield,
that they first dry their dead, preserving them in odd shaped coffins,
until the drying process is completed.&nbsp; They then burn the body,
afterwards collecting the ashes, which are finally deposited in the
mounds over which the conical sheds are erected.&nbsp; Between the village
and the graves I saw one of these coffins which, if it contained a full-grown
man, must have admitted the remains in a mutilated shape; and close
to this were the bones of a corpse lately burnt.</p>
<p>To-day I shot the beautiful yellow and black crested Bird we first
saw on the Cossiya hills, <i>Parus</i> <i>Sultaneus</i>, and two handsome
Birds, <i>Orioles</i>, or <i>Pastor</i> <i>Traillii</i>, quite new to
me, blackish and bright crimson, probably allied to the Shrikes.</p>
<p>Of fishes, Cyprinus falcata, or <i>Nepoora</i> of the Assamese, together
with the Sentooree <a name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75">{75}</a>
of the Assamese, both occur.&nbsp; Of plants, we noticed Stauntonia,
Vitis, Cissampelos, Butomus pygm&aelig;us, Dicksonia, Hedychia 2, Croton
Malv&aelig;folium of Suddiya, Xanthium indicum; Cheilosandra ferruginea,
Pothos scandens decursiva, etc., Liriodendrum, Kydia.&nbsp; Ficus elastica?&nbsp;
Asplenium nidus, Conyza graveolens, south of the old clearings.&nbsp;
Lemna, Valisneria, Azolla, &AElig;sculus asamicus in abundance.&nbsp;
Limes in profusion near Culleyang; P&aelig;deria f&aelig;tida and the
other species, Naravelia, Hir&aelig;a, Phrynium dichotomum, G&aelig;rtnera,
and Carallia lucida.&nbsp; New plants, Ophioglossum, Carex, Gnetum sp.
nov. Choripetalum, and two <i>incerta</i>.&nbsp; Noticed Pladera justicioides
during the first part of the march, and the small Squirrel of Kujoodoo.</p>
<p>Six A.M.&nbsp; Temperature 58&frac12;.&nbsp; Water boiled at 210&deg;
Fahr.&nbsp; 8 P.M.&nbsp; Temperature of the air 66.&nbsp; Altitude 1064
feet.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Started at 6 A.M. and reached Lamoom
about 8, where we breakfasted.&nbsp; Reached Tsilone, the Dupha&rsquo;s
village, at noon.&nbsp; General direction S.W.&nbsp; Distance about
ten miles.&nbsp; Lamoom is a small <i>un</i>stockaded village on the
Moneekha.&nbsp; Tsilone is a moderate sized Singpho village on the right
bank of the Nam Tunail.&nbsp; The river is of considerable size, with
scarcely any rapids: stream slow.&nbsp; The village is situated on a
rather high bank.</p>
<p>The country continues the same, perhaps a little more open, at least
Putars are of frequent occurrence, although they are all narrow.&nbsp;
Observed Cryptolepis, Celastrus <i>leguminoideus</i> Cuscuta Uncaria
racemis pendulis.&nbsp; Of birds the smaller Maina, common house Sparrow,
blue Jay, and the larger grey Tern occur.&nbsp; We halted on a sandbank
about one mile and a half higher up to the south of Tsilone.&nbsp; New
plants, the Campanula of Chykwar, ditto Lysimachia, Dopatrium, Jasminum,
Rhamnea, Pothos, Lasia, Riccia, etc.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer 58&deg;.&nbsp; Boiling
point 210.&nbsp; Altitude 1064 feet.&nbsp; After a long and hot march
of seven hours we reached Meinkhoon; general direction -- distance 17
miles.&nbsp; During the first two hours we marched along the bed and
banks of the Nam Tenai, subsequently over grassy plains intersected
by belts of jungle.&nbsp; Country much more open than that we saw yesterday.&nbsp;
To the W. low ranges of hills, about one-third of a mile distant, occurred
throughout the day.&nbsp; We passed two or three small nullahs, in one
of which I observed lumps of lignite.</p>
<p>The Nam Tenai continued a large river, extreme breadth varying from
250 to 350 yards.&nbsp; We crossed at once, about half a mile from our
encampment, deepest part of the ford four feet; its banks are either
thickly wooded or covered with Kagara jungle.&nbsp; The day&rsquo;s
march was very uninteresting.&nbsp; I observed a few Mango trees, a
Mucuna, Laurine&aelig; are common, as well as a Wendlandia in open grassy
places.&nbsp; Sagittari&aelig; sp. was the only novelty.&nbsp; Noticed
the Hoopoe bird, <i>Upapa</i> <i>Capensis</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>25th</i>.&mdash;Meinkhoon is situated on a very small
nullah, the Eedeekha.&nbsp; The village which is large and well stockaded,
is divided into two by this nullah.&nbsp; The population of both cannot,
including children, be less than 200.&nbsp; They belong to the Meerep
tribe.&nbsp; The women wear the <i>putsoe</i> somewhat like those of
Burma, which seems to me quite new in Singpho women; and is not the
fashion with those in Assam.&nbsp; To the S.W. there is a group of somewhat
decayed Shan Pagodas, and a Poonghie house, around which are planted
mango trees and a beautiful arboreous Bauhinia, B. rhododendriflora
mihi, ovariis binis!&nbsp; Around the village is an extensive plain,
and to the S.E. one or two more Pagodas.&nbsp; This Bauhinia has flowers
1&frac12; inches across, calyx spathaceus, petalis, sub-conformibus,
obovatis, repandis l&aelig;te purpureis, vexillo coccineo-purpureo,
colore saturate venoso, carin&aelig; petalis distantibus, odor Copaiv&aelig;!&nbsp;
Stam. 5 declinata, cum petalis, alternantia.&nbsp; Ovaria 2! anticum
posticumque, longe stipetata, difformia superiore minore, aborticate,
ambobus vexillo oppositis!&nbsp; Stylus ruber pallide; stigma capitatum.&nbsp;
One B. variegata, W. Roxb. Fl. Indic. vol. ii. p.319, quamvis auctor
de ovario antico silet.</p>
<p>Two snakes were captured, approaching in shape to the green snake
of the Coromandel Coast.&nbsp; Under surface throughout bright gamboge
colour; upper surface throughout, excepting about a span or less of
the back of the neck, bright ochraceous brown.&nbsp; The space above
alluded to is in one faintly, in the other strongly variegated with
black and white.&nbsp; Irides, gamboge-coloured.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>26th</i>.&mdash;Visited the amber mines, which are
situated on a range of low hills, perhaps 150 feet above the plain of
Meinkhoon, from which they bear S.W.&nbsp; The distance of the pits
now worked is about six miles, of which three are passed in traversing
the plain, and three in the low hills which it is requisite to cross.&nbsp;
These are thickly covered with tree jungle.&nbsp; The first pits, which
are old, occur about one mile within the hills.&nbsp; Those now worked
occupy the brow of a low hill, and on this spot they are very numerous;
the pits are square, about four feet in diameter, and of very variable
depth; steps, or rather holes, are cut in two of the faces of the square
by which the workmen ascend and descend.&nbsp; The instruments used
are wooden-lipped with iron crowbars, by which the soil is displaced;
this answers but very imperfectly for a pickaxe: small wooden shovels,
baskets for carrying up the soil, etc., buckets of bark to draw up the
water, bamboos, the base of the rhizoma forming a hook for drawing up
the baskets, and the Madras lever for drawing up heavy loads.</p>
<p>The soil throughout the upper portion, and indeed for a depth of
15 to 20 feet, is red and clayish, and appears to inclose but small
pieces of lignite; the remainder consists of greyish slate clay increasing
in density as the pits do in depth: in this occur strata of lignite
very imperfectly formed, which gives the grey mineral a slaty fracture,
and among this the amber is found. <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78">{78}</a>&nbsp;
The deepest pit was about 40 feet, and the workmen had then come to
water.&nbsp; All the amber I saw, except a few pieces, occurred as very
small irregular deposits, and in no great abundance.&nbsp; The searching
occupies but little time, as they look only among the lignite, which
is at once obvious.&nbsp; No precautions are taken to prevent accidents
from the falling in of the sides of the pits, which are in many places
very close to each other (within two feet): but the soil is very tenacious.</p>
<p>We could not obtain any fine specimens; indeed at first the workmen
denied having any at all, and told Mr. B. that they had been working
for six years without success.&nbsp; They appear to have no index to
favourable spots, but having once found a good pit they of course dig
as many as possible as near and close together as they can.&nbsp; The
most numerous occur at the highest part of the hill now worked.&nbsp;
The article is much prized for ornaments by the Chinese and Singphos,
but is never of much value; five rupees being a good price for a first-rate
pair of earrings.&nbsp; Meinkhoon is visited by parties of Chinese for
the purpose of procuring this article.&nbsp; There are at present here
a Lupai Sooba and a few men, from a place three or four days&rsquo;
journey beyond the Irrawaddi, waiting for amber.&nbsp; These men are
much like the Chinese, whose dress they almost wear: they squat like
them, and wear their hair like them; shoes, stockings, pantaloons, jackets,
tunic.&nbsp; They are armed chiefly with firelocks, in the use of which
at 50 yards two of the men were expert enough.&nbsp; They talk the Singpho
language.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the plains, proceeding to the mines, is unchanged.&nbsp;
Noticed Apluda, a Phyllanthus, Cacalia, Poa, etc.&nbsp; That of the
hills is the same as that of the low ranges before traversed.&nbsp;
The only new plants were a Celtis? a Krameria (the Celtis is the Boolla
of Upper Assam,) Ventilago, Quercus or Castanea, Composit&aelig;, etc.&nbsp;
In the damp places a largish Loxotis, two or three Begoni&aelig;, ditto
Urtice&aelig; occur.&nbsp; I noticed among and around the pits a species
of Bambusa, Celtis, Kydia calycina, Clerodendrum infortunatum, Calamus,
Areca, Dicksonia, Ficus, Pentaptera, and Rottlera.&nbsp; Pladera has
ceased to appear.</p>
<p>Last night a sort of alarm occurred, and in consequence, this evening,
the head cooly gave his orders to his men in the following terms: &ldquo;Watch
to-night well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody answering him, he continued, &ldquo;Do
you hear what I say?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then addressed himself to them in
the most obscene terms, which habit and uncivilized life seem to have
adapted to common conversation amongst these people without any breach
of modesty or decorum; and amongst the Assamese such expressions likewise
form not an uncommon mode of familiar salutation.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>27th</i>.&mdash;Left about 7, and proceeded over
the Meinkhoon plain in an easterly direction, in which the highest hills
visible from the village lay.&nbsp; We continued east for some time,
our course subsequently becoming more and more south.&nbsp; On reaching
the Nempyokha, we proceeded up its bed for about two miles, the course
occasionally becoming west.&nbsp; We reached Wollaboom at 12&frac12;.&nbsp;
General direction S.E.; distance thirteen miles.&nbsp; The greater part
of the country traversed consisted of low plains, splendidly adapted
for <i>halee</i> cultivation.&nbsp; No villages were passed.&nbsp; Saw
two paths, one leading to the N., one to the S. not far from Meinkhoon;
of these the N. one leads to the hills, the S. to a Singpho village.&nbsp;
And we passed burial places of some antiquity, and considerable extent.&nbsp;
New plants; a Loranthus floribus viridibus, petalis 6 reflexis.&nbsp;
Zizyphoidea, and an arborescent Bignonia foliis cordatis oppositis,
integris, basi bi-glandulosis, paniculis racemiformibus, solitariis
et axillaribus vel terminalibus et aggregatis.&nbsp; Marlea Sporobolus,
Castanea edulis, Pteris dimediata, etc., occurred.&nbsp; Noticed the
tracks of a Tiger, of Elks, and the Peewit or Curlew.</p>
<p>Woollaboom is rather a large village on the Nempyokha, which is here
scarcely 40 yards broad; it is of no depth, and has not much stream.&nbsp;
The villagers are Meereps, but seem to bear a small proportion to their
Assamese slaves.&nbsp; It is not stockaded, but was so formerly.&nbsp;
The Souba, like a Hero and a General, has erected a small stockade for
himself near his house, out of which he might be with ease forced by
a long spear, or a spear-head fastened to a bamboo.&nbsp; He is an enemy
of the Duphas, indeed almost all appear to be so.&nbsp; Whatever events
the return of this Gam to Assam may cause, it appears obvious to me,
that the feuds in Hookhoom will not cease but with his death.&nbsp;
So much is he hated, that B. informs me that his destruction is meditated
directly the Meewoon retires to Mogam.</p>

<p><i>Continues</i> <i>the</i> <i>Journey</i> <i>from</i> <i>Hookhoom</i>
<i>Valley</i>; <i>Lat</i>. <i>26&deg;20'</i> <i>N</i>., <i>Long</i>.
<i>96&deg;40'</i> <i>E</i>., <i>towards</i> <i>Ava</i>.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>28th</i>.&mdash;Started at 5&frac12; A.M., and arrived
at a halting place at 3&frac12; P.M.&nbsp; General direction nearly
south.&nbsp; Distance 22 miles.&nbsp; Throughout the first part we followed
the Kampyet, on the left bank of which Wulloboom is situated.&nbsp;
We thence diverged into jungle.&nbsp; The remainder of the time was
occupied in crossing low hills, with here and there a small plain.&nbsp;
We halted on a nullah, which discharges itself into the Mogam river.</p>
<p>In the Kampyet I saw abundance of Bookhar fish: these indeed actually
swarm.&nbsp; The country throughout was uninteresting, although in the
tree jungle clothing the small hills we crossed there are noble timber
trees.&nbsp; I saw one of the finest Fici, I ever saw.&nbsp; The Botany
of these hills was very interesting; for instance, a Conifera taxoidea
occurred, a new Cyrtandracea, ditto Acanthace&aelig; 2, Begoni&aelig;
2, Tankervillia speciosa, a species of Bletea, etc. etc.</p>
<p>I also observed Linds&aelig;a, and Pteris in abundance.&nbsp; Hymenophyllum,
Davallia atrata, Diplazium, Begonia Malabarica? Bambusa spiculis hispidis,
Hypni sp. spinivenio prop. Dicranum glaucum, etc. etc.&nbsp; A fine
Alpinia occurred near Wulloboom.</p>
<p>We observed no other signs of population than an old burial ground,
near where you strike off into the hills.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>29th</i>.&mdash;Marched in a southerly direction
from 5&frac12; to 1&frac12; P.M., inclusive of a halt of two hours nearly:
distance fifteen miles.&nbsp; Country, etc. continue the same.&nbsp;
Crossed same nullahs <i>en</i> <i>route</i>, before we reached the Mogam
river at 11 A.M.&nbsp; Our course continued down it for 300 yards; we
then crossed into the jungle, and traversed a low rising ground: subsequently
we descended on the bed of the river.&nbsp; The jungle was for the most
part dry.</p>
<p>Fish abound in the Mogam river; in one place I never saw such swarms
of Bookhar, thousands must have been congregated.&nbsp; The river is
of no great size, the extreme banks being at our halting place about
30 yards distant.&nbsp; No rapids occur here, and the stream is in general
gentle.</p>
<p>Noticed the Shorea, which is the <i>Foung</i> <i>bein</i> of the
Burmese.&nbsp; Some occurred of gigantic size.&nbsp; It is strange,
but a considerable change has occurred in the Flora since we left Hookhoom.&nbsp;
Thus, Jonesia and Peronema, Jack? or at least one of the involucrate
Vitices occurred, as well as a large Byttneria? fructibus echinatissimis.&nbsp;
A climbing species of Strychnos, a Diospyros, a Sapindacea, were the
principal new plants.&nbsp; Dicksonia and Polypodium Wallichianum continue.</p>
<p>Slackia of Cuttackboom has white infundibuliform bilabiate flowers,
tubo brevi, deorsum leniter curvato, lobo medio labii inferioris reliquis
minore, lab. super.&nbsp; intus biplicato, plicis sursum convergentibus,
stam. quinto valde rudimentario, antheris apice coh&aelig;rentibus.&nbsp;
The new Cyrthandracea of yesterday is suigeneris, Ramondi&aelig; affinis.&nbsp;
Of this there are three species, two of which I have not seen in flower.&nbsp;
Calycis lacini&aelig; lineari-subulat&aelig;.&nbsp; Cor. rotata, subregularis
Stam. 4, subsessilia connectivis amplis, quinto minimo dentiformi.&nbsp;
Stylus declinatus, Stigma subsimplex, Capsula (per junior) siliquosa.&nbsp;
Herb&aelig; vel suffrutices, hispid&aelig;, habitu peculiari.&nbsp;
Folia alterna! vel summa sparsa vel ob approximationem sub-opposita:
intervenia areolata, areolis piliferis, pilis basi bulbosis.&nbsp; Inflorescentia
axillaris, cymosa, dichotoma.</p>
<p>The Tankervellia (or Pharus?) has sepala pet. conformia extus alba,
intus fusco-brunnea, labellum cucullatum, breve, calcaratum; intus inconspicue
bilamellatum; extus albidum margines versus exceptis qua uti intus fusco-sanguineum,
fauce saturatiore.&nbsp; Column&aelig; alb&aelig; clavale sursum subulata.&nbsp;
Anthera fere immersa, Rostellum integrum ut in omnibus glandula orbotis
Pollinia 8.&nbsp; 5 A.M.&mdash;Temperature 62. 210.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>30th</i>.&mdash;Marched for about thirteen miles
along the bed of the river, and a more uninteresting march I never had.&nbsp;
We breakfasted about four miles from our halting place at the granary
of the Meewoon.&nbsp; The bed of the river continues wider, and more
sandy: the water being in general shallow.&nbsp; The only acquisitions
met with to-day are Grislea, an arborescent Capparidea, and a pretty
Grewia.&nbsp; Of birds, I noticed the Avocet, or curved-billed Plover,
the grey Kingfisher, the green Pigeon, and the snake-bird, Plutus Levalliantia.&nbsp;
The plants occupying the banks and the bed of the river are the same,
viz. Ehretia, Saccharum spontaneum, spirale; <i>Kagara</i>, Erythrina,
Ficus, Gnaphalia, Podomolee, Bombax.&nbsp; Of fish, Cyprinus falcata,
and <i>Nepoora</i> <i>mas</i>, occur in this river.</p>
<p>Temperature at 5&frac14; A.M. 6l.&nbsp; Water boils at 210.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>31st</i>.&mdash;Continued our march down the Mogaung
river, passing through a most uninteresting, inhospitable-looking tract.&nbsp;
General direction S.E., distance fourteen miles.&nbsp; The river is
not much enlarged: it is still shallow, and much spread out, and impeded
by fallen trees and stumps; it is navigable for small boats up to the
Meewoon&rsquo;s granary.&nbsp; Noticed &AElig;sculus in flower.&nbsp;
Of birds, saw the grey and black-bellied Tern.</p>
<p>The Botanical novelties are an arborescent Salix, a ditto Cordia
floribus suave odoratis, Phyllanthus Embelica.</p>
<p>Saw some cultivation on low hills to the S.E. and E. inhabited by
Kukheens.&nbsp; 1st April.&nbsp; Temperature 63.&nbsp; Water 210&frac14;
altitude.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Started at 5&frac14;.&nbsp; Leaving
almost directly the Mogaung river we traversed extensive open plains,
halting for breakfast on the Wampama Kioung.&nbsp; This we crossed,
continuing through open plains until we came to patches of jungle consisting
of trees, and quite dry.&nbsp; We subsequently traversed more open plains
until we reached the Mogaung river, on the opposite (right) bank of
which Camein is situated.&nbsp; These plains were in many places quite
free from trees; they are, except towards the south, quite surrounded
with low hills, the highest of which are to the E., and among these,
Shewe Down Gyee, from which the Nam Tenai rises, is pre-eminent, looking
as if it were 3000 feet high, and upwards.&nbsp; The hills although
generally wooded are in many places quite naked; and as the natives
say, this is not owing to previous cultivations, I suppose that they
are spots naturally occupied entirely by Gramine&aelig;.&nbsp; The plains
slope towards the hills on either side.&nbsp; They are covered with
Gramine&aelig;; among which Imperata, occasionally Podomolee and Saccharum,
Anthistiria arundinacea, a tall Rottboelia, and Andropogon occur; and
in the more open spaces a curious Rottboellioidea, glumis ciliatis,
is common.&nbsp; In addition a Polygala, a Crucifera with bracte&aelig;
and white flowers, an Acanthacea, Prenanthes? Centranthera tetrastachys
are met with.&nbsp; The trees are quite different from those of Hookhoom;
the principal one is a Nauclea; Bombax, Wendlandi&aelig; sp., a Rhamnea,
Phyllanthus, and Bignonia cordifolia occur; the Nauclea giving a character
to the scenery.&nbsp; The Botany of the patches of jungle is varied.&nbsp;
Strychnos Nux-vomica is common; Congea tomentosa, Engelhardtia, etc.&nbsp;
Bauhinia arborea, and Costus also occur.</p>
<p>Teak occurred to-day for the first time, but not in abundance, neither
were the specimens fine: it was past flowering, it occurred only between
the patches of jungle among grass.&nbsp; I should have mentioned, that
throughout the first portion of the plains traversed, a dioceous dwarf
Ph&oelig;nix was not rare, as well as an Herpestes.&nbsp; A beautiful
Rose occurs on the banks of nullahs, and at Camein, on the Mogaung river:
it has large white flowers, involucrate; smell sweet like that of a
Jonquil.</p>
<p>The general direction of the march was S.S.E.&nbsp; Distance fourteen
miles.</p>
<p>Camein consists of two stockaded villages: the smaller one being
situated on a small hill on the Endaw Kioung, which comes from near
the serpentine mines, and falls into the Mogaung river here; this has
about twelve houses: the one below about twenty, the inhabitants are
Shans chiefly, and appear numerous and healthy.&nbsp; Assamese slaves
are not uncommon.</p>
<p>Observed the large blue Kingfisher of the Tenasserim coast, <i>Alcedo</i>
<i>sinensis</i>.</p>
<p>The day&rsquo;s Botany was very interesting, more so than that of
any other days, excepting two on the higher ranges of the Naga hills.&nbsp;
The Crucifera is highly interesting.&nbsp; In the woods Alstonia and
Elephantopus; Salvinia is common in marshes.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Left at 10 A.M., proceeding over the
low hill to the W. of lower Camein; our course continued traversing
low ranges and small intermediate plains, which we skirted.&nbsp; At
noon we reached the Tsee Een nullah, where we found a large party of
Shan Chinese, returning from the mines; they had but few Ponies, and
still fewer Mules.&nbsp; Their dress, appearance, habits, etc. are those
of the lower orders of Chinese.&nbsp; After leaving this our course
continued over similar country, until we reached the Endaw Kioung at
3 P.M., which we crossed, halting on its left bank; it is a stream of
much strength and a broad bed, but shallow.&nbsp; We saw some cultivation
on low hills to the W.N.W., and could distinguish two or three houses;
it is a small village inhabited by Meereps.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the valleys or plains continues the same, but in
addition to the Rottboelleoidea minor, is a curious Andropogon, and
on the skirts of the hills a large Anthistiria; some of the finest specimens
of teak also occurred.&nbsp; Bamboo in abundance; otherwise the trees
are, with a few exceptions, completely changed.&nbsp; A fine arborescent
Wendlandia, Bignonia indica? fructibus siliquo-formibus spiraliter tortis,
arborea, Kydia, Eurya arborea, and many other fine trees occurred, but
these I leave until my return.&nbsp; On one plain I noticed a Cycas,
caudice simplici vel dichotomo, and the Ph&oelig;nix of yesterday.&nbsp;
In the Endaw Kioung two species of Potamogeton, Azolla, and Pistia,
Villarsia and Ceratophyllum occur.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;5&frac14; A.M.&nbsp; Therm. 55.&nbsp;
Water boiled at 210.&nbsp; Elevation 1064 feet.</p>
<p>Continued our journey over similar country, marching from half-past
5 to 1 P.M., including an hour&rsquo;s halt.&nbsp; Distance fifteen
miles: general direction S.S.W.&nbsp; Passed many streamlets, and continued
for some time close to the Endaw, which is still a largish river, apparently
deep, with a sluggish stream.&nbsp; The plains continue, but of much
narrower diameter.&nbsp; Met many Shan Chinese and two parties of Mogaung
people returning from the mines.</p>
<p>The most interesting plants of to-day are a Santalacea, a climbing
species, racemis subpendulis, of Citrus&mdash;Citrus scandens, Cardiopteris
of which I found old fruit alone, a new Roydsia, R. parviflora mihi.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the plains continues unchanged, a Dillenia with
small yellow flowers is common on their skirts, Bignonia cordata occurs
as a large tree; no one has seen teak.&nbsp; There is something peculiar
in the appearance of the trees of the plains, especially of the Nauclea;
they look scraggy.&nbsp; I picked up the flowers of an arborescent Hibiscus,
and the fruit of Lagertr&aelig;mia grandiflora.</p>
<p>Halted on an old rice khet, near a pool of tolerably clear water.</p>
<p>Bignonia cordata has sweet smelling flowers, lab. medio labii inferioris
bicristato.&nbsp; Is it not rather a Viticea, owing to the absence of
the 5th stamen?&nbsp; Phlebochiton, Sambucus, Butomus pygm&aelig;us.&nbsp;
Many portions of the hills are covered with plantains in immense numbers,
(not Musa glauca).&nbsp; On hills bounding to the south, one or two
spots of cultivation belonging to a village in the interior occur.&nbsp;
The Shans wear curious sandals made of a sort of hemp, at least those
who do not wear the usual Chinese shoes.&nbsp; <i>4th</i>.&mdash;5&frac14;
A.M.&nbsp; Temperature 55&frac12;.&nbsp; Water boiled at 210.&nbsp;
Elevation as before.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Continued our course through exactly
the same kind of country, the plains becoming much narrower.&nbsp; Reached
the path leading to Keouk Seik after five hours&rsquo; marching, and
up to this our course was nearly the same with that of yesterday, between
W.S.W. and S.W.&nbsp; We did not see the village; several (seven or
eight) houses are visible on the hill, which here extends north and
south, and along which runs a nullah, the Kam Theem.</p>
<p>From this place our course continued almost entirely over low hills
not exceeding 800 feet above us, until we halted on the margin of a
plain bounded to the W. by the Boom, which runs N. and S., the direction
being W.N.W.&nbsp; Distance seventeen miles.&nbsp; On our march we met
several parties of Shans, Burmese, and Singphos.&nbsp; The path from
the village to this is much better, and much more frequented than any
of the other parts.&nbsp; Most of the parties were loaded with Serpentine.&nbsp;
Noticed <i>en</i> <i>route</i>, both on the plains and on the hills,
Teak; in the latter situations many of the specimens were very fine.&nbsp;
Another noble Dipterocarpea arborea was observed.&nbsp; I observed Drymaria,
Vallaris solanacea, and a Spathodia, which is common on the plains.&nbsp;
Teak is remarkable for the smoothness and peculiar appearance of its
bark, so that it seems to have had it stripped off.</p>
<p>Gathered on the hills Ulmus and Hyalostemma, the petals of which
are united into a tri-partite corolla, a Cyrtandracea in fruit, and
an Olacinea, floribus tri-sepalis, appendicibus 6 apice fimbriatis,
stam. 3, sepalis oppositis, racemis erectis.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Reached the mines after a march of
about four hours; our course was winding, continuing through jungle
and small patches of plain, until we reached the base of that part of
the Kuwa Boom which we were to cross, and which bore N.W. from the place
at which we slept.&nbsp; The ascent was steep in some places, it bore
in a N.N.W.&nbsp; direction, principally through a bamboo jungle.&nbsp;
From a clear space half way up, we had a fine and pretty view of the
hills and plains, especially to the S. and S.E.&nbsp; In the former
direction, and distant about fifteen miles, we saw on our return, the
Endaw Gyee, but we could not estimate its size or figure; it is evidently
however a large sheet of water; the natives say, several miles across.&nbsp;
From the summit, we likewise had a fine view of the country to the E.;
very few plains were visible in this direction.&nbsp; Nearly due east,
and about thirty miles off, was visible Shewe Down Gyee, and this will
make Camein nearly due east also, or E. by S.&nbsp; The descent passed
through similar jungle, that at the foot being damp.&nbsp; The course
continued in a direction varying from S. to W., or rather between these
points, through damp jungle.&nbsp; We then ascended another steep hill,
but not exceeding 5 or 600 feet in height; descending from this, and
passing through low tree and then bamboo jungle, we reached the mines.</p>
<p>The road was, up to the base of Kuwa Boom on the W. side, very good,
thence it was in general bad; wet, slippery, much impeded by blocks
of serpentine, and foliated limestone (Bayfield) crossing several streams,
mountain torrents, the principal one being Sapya Khioung.&nbsp; This
takes its name from a spring of water of alkaline properties, which
bubbles up sparingly from under its rocky bed, and which must be covered
during the rains.&nbsp; The water is clear, of a pure alkaline taste,
and is used by the natives as soap.</p>
<p>The mines occupy a valley of a somewhat semi-circular form, bounded
on all sides by hills clothed with trees, none being of very great height.&nbsp;
The valley passes off to the N. into a ravine, down which the small
stream that percolates the valley escapes, and in this at about a coss
distant other pits occur.&nbsp; The surface of the valley apparently
at one time consisted of low rounded hillocks; it is now much broken,
and choked up with the earth and stones that have been thrown up by
excavating.&nbsp; The stone is found in the form of more or less rounded
boulders imbedded with others, such as quartz, etc. in brickish-yellow
or nearly orange clay.&nbsp; The boulders vary much in size.&nbsp; There
is no regularity in the pits, which are dug indiscriminately; some have
the form of ditches, none exceed 20 feet in depth.&nbsp; They are dug
all over the valley, as well as on the base of the hill bounding it
to the W. and N.W.&nbsp; We could not obtain any good specimens, nor
is there any thing in the spot that repays the visit.&nbsp; No machinery
is used, the larger blocks are broken by fire.&nbsp; But that they are
of importance in the light of increasing the revenue, is evident, from
the fact that B. counted, since we left Camein, 1,100 people on their
return, of whom about 700 were Shan Chinese.&nbsp; The loads carried
away are in some cases very heavy; the larger pieces are carried on
bamboo frames by from two to five men, the lesser on a stout piece of
bamboo lashed to and supported on two cross or forked bamboos, the stouter
joint resting on the bearer&rsquo;s neck, the handles of the forks being
carried in his hands.&nbsp; The most obvious advantage of this is the
ease with which the load may be taken off, when the bearer is fatigued.&nbsp;
The revenue yielded last year, B. tells me, was 320 viss of silver,
or about 40,000 rupees.&nbsp; The length of the valley from E. to W.
is about three quarters of a mile; its breadth varies from 460 to 800
yards.</p>
<p>On our return we boiled water at the Soap spring, which is about
50 feet above the mines, Temp. of the air 80&frac12;.&nbsp; 2&frac12;
P.M. of boiling water 209.&nbsp; Elevation 1600 feet.&nbsp; And on the
top of Kuwa Boom, which is crossed at a comparatively low place, at
4&frac12; P.M. Temp. of the air 76, of boiling water 207.&nbsp; Elevation
2678 feet.</p>
<p>I can say nothing as to the peculiar features of the vegetation,
in the woods towards Kuwa Boom.&nbsp; I gathered three Aurantiace&aelig;;
the Olacinea of yesterday is common, a large arborescent Artocarpus
fructibus oblongis sub-informibus, sub-acidulis, &frac34; uncialibus;
Teak rarely; Tonabea, noble specimens occur; on the Kuwa Boom, a large
Gordonia arborea, two arborescent Myrtacea, large Mangoes, Bamboo, a
Morinda; Magnoli&aelig;cea occurs on its western face, as well as the
Conifera toxoidea before gathered.&nbsp; Dicksonia and Pladera justicioidea
both occur.&nbsp; Dianella nemorosa, etc.&nbsp; The Serpentine is carried
from Keoukseik in boats down the Endaw Kioung, thence to Camein, and
from whence it goes to Mogam, which is probably the principal mart.&nbsp;
Calamus spioris petiolorum uncialibus verticillatis occurs in abundance
in all the damp jungle.</p>
<p>We returned in the afternoon to our halting place of yesterday, from
which the mines are distant ten miles, four of which occur from the
side of Kuwa Boom to the West.&nbsp; The Endaw Gyee is situated on a
plain, but it is enclosed by hills on every side except the S.E.&nbsp;
Those to the south are very high.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;Returned, diverging from the path
to the village Keoukseik.&nbsp; Noticed Liriodendron, &AElig;sculus,
Achyranthis aspera, Vallaris solanacea, etc.</p>
<p>The village is situated to the S. of the road to the mines; it is
close to the Nam Teen, and on a small elevation; it is stockaded.&nbsp;
The number of houses is about sixteen; of inhabitants, including children,
120: all the houses, except two, being small.&nbsp; The merchants, etc.
employed about the mines, halt on the Nam Theen, which is up to this
point navigable for small boats.</p>
<p>Thermometer 66.&nbsp; 6&frac12; A.M.&nbsp; Temp. of boiling water
210.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>8th</i>.&mdash;Reached Camein at noon: halted on
the 7th at our former hut on the Endaw Kioung.&nbsp; The additional
plants noticed are Duchesnia indica, common in wet places; a Bamboo,
paniculis (culmis) nutantibus aphyllis, amplus.&nbsp; Pandanus; Curculigo
pumila, floribus sub-solitarius ante folia, 6 vel. 4 partitis; a Careya,
Dillenia, arborea floribus numerosis parvis luteis.</p>
<p>&AElig;schynomena, Anthistiria arundinacea, Composita arborea, 40-50
pedalis.&nbsp; Another species of Anthistiria, common on the margins
of hills during the march.&nbsp; Fir trees are reported to exist on
<i>Lioe</i> <i>Peik</i>, which bears South from Kioukseik.&nbsp; Volcanic
hills reported to exist near the Endaw Gyee, but no salt rock occurs.&nbsp;
This mineral is said to be found three days&rsquo; march from Kioukseik
on the Nam Theen.&nbsp; The revenue said to accrue from the Serpentine
mines, is probably highly exaggerated; and the supply of the stone is
said to be diminishing yearly.&nbsp; Casually found on the Nam Toroon,
a Sterculia arborea, florib-masculis clavato, infundibul. coccineis,
pubescentibus: a Sophora, floribus albidis pallidissima ceruleo tinctis,
of which the flowers alone were seen; Prenanthis flosentis citrinis,
a Polygala and Hypericum were likewise found.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Left Camein at 6, and reached Mogoung
at 6 P.M. after a march of at least twenty-five miles.&nbsp; The course
at first was nearly due east, until we reached the Nam Pong, but subsequently
it became more southerly.&nbsp; Camein bears from this about S.S.E.&nbsp;
The country traversed was the same, generally comparatively open, that
is to say, grassy plains with Rhamnea, Nauclea, Bombax, etc.&nbsp; For
some distance the path extended through shady woods.&nbsp; No villages,
nor any signs of such were observed <i>en</i> <i>route</i>.&nbsp; We
passed many streamlets particularly during the latter half of the march.&nbsp;
Our original intention was to have come to Mogoung by water, and with
this view Bayfield told the man sent by the Myoowook to procure two
or three canoes.&nbsp; At 6 A.M. the Havildar came up to our hut, and
said that the headman of the village was disputing violently about our
taking the boats.&nbsp; Bayfield proceeded down to the river side, where
the Yua Thugee was very insolent, and he and his followers drew their
<i>dhaos</i> (swords) on Bayfield, who slightly pushed the Thugee.&nbsp;
It ended in our going by land.&nbsp; We had previously heard of the
rebellion at Ava: the Thugee&rsquo;s behaviour evidently arose partly
from this.&nbsp; I did not observe the dispute, as I remained near the
stockade.</p>
<p>Noticed a Lonicera in low places, and the Viola of Suddiya on the
plains, a Cardiopteris, Kempferia, Curcuma, a Bambusa vaginis collo
barbatis, a scandent Strychnos, an Aerides, Ardisi&aelig; 2, some Acanthace&aelig;,
Loxotis major, Urtice&aelig; 2 or 3, Santalacea as before, Tetranther&aelig;,
Davallia atrata, Asplenium fronde simplici, etc. etc.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;We halt, and hear a report of the
death of Mr. Kincaid, and that a Burmese army is <i>en</i> <i>route</i>
here.&nbsp; The whole country is most unsettled, all the Singphos and
Khukeens being in open rebellion.&nbsp; It appears that Thurrawaddi
is meeting with success in his summons for men.&nbsp; No resistance
shewn to his authority hitherto except by one Myoowoon.&nbsp; Our Myoowoon
has absented himself, and the Myoowook determined on surrender.&nbsp;
Bayfield under all circumstances, and failing authentic intelligence
of Mr. Kincaid, resolves on remaining here.</p>
<p>Mogam is a rather pretty town, situated on the right bank of the
Mogoung river, at the confluence of a river 100 yards broad, the water
of which spreads out, in some places, to a considerable breadth and
depth.&nbsp; The country is however low, flooded in the rains, and surrounded
by hills, except in the direction of Shewe Down Gyee.&nbsp; In many
places it is only covered with grass.&nbsp; The town is large, and was
formerly stockaded, the remains of the timber stockade being still visible.&nbsp;
It contains about 300 houses, about 2,500 inhabitants, mostly Shans.&nbsp;
The houses are generally raised, in many cases like those of the Kampties,
the chopper coming low down, shaped like a turtle&rsquo;s back.&nbsp;
There is a very distinct opening or chasm in the hills between S. D.
Gyee and a low range to the North, but no river makes its exit there.&nbsp;
Sunday, 16th.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>18th</i>.&mdash;Halted up to this date, waiting for
information especially regarding the army at Tsenbo.</p>
<p>In this place two fragrant Dipterocarpe&aelig; are found; as also
Bixa, Tamarindus, and Carthamus, which last is cultivated and used both
for food and dyeing.&nbsp; About the Poongie houses some remarkable
Fici occur, the trunk being divided so low down as to give the idea
of a group of several trees.&nbsp; The roots in addition are made to
spread over the conical mounds, thrown up at their bases.</p>
<p>A race of wild-looking short men, called Lupai Khakoos, inhabit this
vicinity, wearing a jacket, and dark-blue cloth with an ornamented border,
worn with the ends overlapping in front.&nbsp; They wear garters of
the Suwa.&nbsp; Their hair is worn either long or cropped, and a beard
is also occasionally worn by the elders.</p>
<p>In this place very few regular Chinese are to be found, and the few
that are here seen, are ultra-provincials; none are acquainted with
the manufacture of tea.&nbsp; This article is procurable here, but at
a high rate; it is sold in flat cakes of some diameter; it is black,
coarse, with scarcely any smell, and in taste not much superior to the
Assamese article; 20 tickals weight sells for 1&frac14;.&nbsp; All the
blue cloths of the Shans are dyed, Bayfield informs me, with Ruellia,
or jungle indigo.</p>
<p>It is with these people that the only trade seems to be carried on,
and this is limited to amber and serpentine.&nbsp; They are very dirty,
and excessively penurious, but industrious.&nbsp; Owing to their habits
and extreme penury, there is no outlet for our manufactures in this
direction; so that I fully agree with Hannay&rsquo;s statement, that
500 rupees worth of British goods would be unabsorbed for some years.&nbsp;
Rosa is common, also a Rumex; a Sisymbroid plant also occurs.&nbsp;
Among the trees, all which are stunted, Gmelina arborea occurs.&nbsp;
There are some Assamese slaves here among the people, one of them is
said to be a relation of Chundra Kant, the Suddiya chief: slaves are
held in very small estimation with the Burmese.&nbsp; Thus Bayfield
asked his writer, who such a one standing near him was, whether a Shan
or Singpho?&nbsp; The man answered, &ldquo;My lord, it is not a man;
it is a Waidalee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Altogether, Mogoung is an uninteresting place; the surrounding plains
are barren-looking, and inhospitable, and clothed with grass.&nbsp;
Here and there a ragged Nauclea, Careya, etc. is visible with Gmelina
arborea.&nbsp; The undershrubs are chiefly a Rhamnoidea, and a Phyllanthus.&nbsp;
Rosa is common; Rumex and Nasturtium are both met with.</p>
<p>News arrived yesterday evening to the effect, that the King is drowned,
the heir-apparent in the palace: and that Colonel Burney is with Thurrawadi!!!</p>
<p>My collections up to this place amount to 900 species.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>19th</i>.&mdash;Left at 12, and halted after having
gone about four miles.&nbsp; The river continues the same as above;
it is a good deal impeded by trees, and much more so by sandbanks.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>20th</i>.&mdash;Reached Tapaw in the afternoon; our
progress is, however, very slow the stream being slight, but the river
is much improved; being less spread out, owing to its greater proximity
to the low hills: often very deep, generally clothed with jungle to
the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; On the hills near Tapaw are some Khukeens
of the Thampraw tribe, and on these hills bitter tea is reported to
be found.&nbsp; This the Khukeens bring down for sale.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>21st</i>.&mdash;Continued our course, performing
about twelve miles between 7 and 5, inclusive of one hour&rsquo;s halt.&nbsp;
At some distance from Tapaw and thence throughout the day, here and
there occur rapids, which are much worse, from the stream being impeded
by large rocks.&nbsp; In some places it is divided, in others, compressed
between hills, and here it is very deep.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Arrived at the Irrawaddi.&nbsp; The
Mogoung river is very uninteresting; the stream being generally slow,
sandbanks very abundant, as well as stumps of sunken trees.&nbsp; At
its mouth it is deep, and about seventy yards across.&nbsp; The banks
are either overgrown with trees or else grassy; the grasses being Arundo
and Saccharum.&nbsp; On the steep banks of the hills where these descend
into the river, ferns are common together with an Amaryllidea out of
flower.&nbsp; Cadaba is common, as well as a large Mimosea.&nbsp; Rosa
continues; as also &AElig;sculus.&nbsp; On the road by which the Chinese
branch off from Tapaw to the Irrawaddi, I gathered an arborescent Apocynea
foliis suboppositis, and a Homalineous tree, floribus tetrameris; Salix
is common all down the river.&nbsp; Teak only occurs occasionally.&nbsp;
In one place I gathered Lonicera heterophylla, a fragrant Valeriana?
and Jonesia in abundance; this last being here apparently quite wild.&nbsp;
Adelia nereifolia, a Ficus, Ehretia arenarum, and the usual sandy plants
occur on the banks.&nbsp; Pistia, Salvinia and Azolla are common.</p>
<p>The Irrawaddi opposite the entrance of the Mogoung river, is 600
yards across.&nbsp; It is a noble stream; has risen a good deal, and
presents one unbroken sheet of water.&nbsp; The banks are by no means
high, and are grassed to the brink.&nbsp; The water is cold and clouded;
its temperature is 66&frac12;&deg;, that of air in a boat 88&frac12;.&nbsp;
We reached Tsenbo about 1 o&rsquo;clock, having passed five or six villages,
mostly small, and inhabited by Shans.&nbsp; Tsenbo numbers about 30
houses, but these as throughout Burma, as far as we have seen, are small;
it is situated on a low hill on the left bank.&nbsp; Both banks are
hilly, especially the right.&nbsp; The river has risen enormously during
a halt here&mdash;many feet.&nbsp; In one hour we found it to rise about
16 inches.&nbsp; At this place I gathered a fine blue Vanda, and a curious
tree habitu Thespi&aelig;: stigmatibus 4.&nbsp; Between this and the
entrance to the narrow defile Kioukdweng, which is about 1&frac12; miles
distant, three villages occur.&nbsp; This entrance is well marked, the
river becoming suddenly contracted from 300 to less than 100 yards.&nbsp;
We halted about 6&frac12; P.M. at Lemar.&nbsp; Noticed four or five
villages between Lemar and the village at the entrance of the defile.&nbsp;
All these villages are inhabited by Poans, a distinct hill tribe.&nbsp;
Passed through two fearful places, one in particular where the whole
body of water rushes through a <i>gate</i>, formed by huge rocks not
50 yards wide.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Continued our course, and arrived
at Bamoo about 5&frac12; P.M.; the greater part of the journey extended
through the Kioukdweng, or defile, in which some terrific places occur,
one in particular known by two rocks which are called the Elephant and
Cow.&nbsp; Passed several small villages before we made our exit from
the K. dweng: all inhabited by Poans.&nbsp; Between this and Bamoo the
country along the river is truly magnificent, and is well inhabited.&nbsp;
The largest village contains about 70 houses; at least seven or eight
occur, between the points above noted.</p>
<p>The Kioukdweng is a remarkable and an awful object.&nbsp; The greatest
breadth of the river while confined within this defile does not exceed
250 yards, and in all the bad places it is contracted to within 100,
occasionally 50.&nbsp; From the enormous rise of the river, which, last
night alone amounted to an increase of ten feet, the passage is one
continued scene of anxiety.&nbsp; In the places above referred to the
river rushes by with great velocity, while the return waters caused
on either side by the surrounding rocks, occasion violent eddies and
whirlpools, so as to render the boat unmanageable, and if upset the
best swimmer could not live in these places.&nbsp; The rocks are serpentine
and grey limestone, presenting angular masses which project into the
stream; the former in all places within high-water mark is of a dark-brown
colour.&nbsp; Micaceous slate? likewise occurs, although rarely.&nbsp;
The depth is of course enormous, in the low state of the river, when
Bayfield passed up, in many places no bottom was found, at 25 or even
40 fathoms, and at this season the water had no doubt risen 40 feet
higher.&nbsp; Some idea of the rise that has taken place may be formed
from the fact, that in places where, when Bayfield passed up, the stream
did not exceed 70 yards in width, it was now 200; and of course a rise
of 20 feet in the open river, would determine one of at least 40 within
the K. dweng.&nbsp; After passing the Elephant and Cow, which have the
usual resemblance implied by their fanciful names, the river widens
and becomes tranquil.&nbsp; The whole of this Kioukdweng is truly remarkable,
and in many places very picturesque.</p>
<p>The vegetation is, I imagine, similar to that of the low hills about
Mogoung; but so dangerous was the passage, that I had but few opportunities
of going ashore.&nbsp; The hills are thinly wooded, and all bear many
impressions of former clearings; but the spots now under cultivation
are certainly few.&nbsp; Besides, we must bear in mind, that the spots
cultivated generally throughout thinly populated parts of India are
deserted after the first crop, so that a very limited population may
clear a great extent of ground.&nbsp; Bayfield tells me, and I consider
his authority as excellent, that the population is almost entirely limited
to the villages seen during the passage.&nbsp; These do not exceed twelve,
and they are all small.&nbsp; None of the hills exceed 500 feet in height
(apparently,) they do not present any very peculiar features.</p>
<p>Below the maximum high-water mark the vegetation is all stunted,
at least that of the rocks; a tufted Graminea is the most common.&nbsp;
Adelia nereifolia (Roxb.), a Celastrinea, a curious Rubiacea, which
I also have from Moulmain, two Myrtace&aelig;, a Rungia, are the most
common.&nbsp; I did not observe Podocarpus.&nbsp; In the occasionally
sandy spots Campanula, the usual Composit&aelig;, Panica three.&nbsp;
Eleusine, Clenopodium, and Atriplex are common, a Stemodia, and Asclepiadea
likewise occur.&nbsp; One Clematis carpellis imberbibus, and the Lonicera
are met with.&nbsp; No mosses appear to occur.&nbsp; One remarkable
tree, <i>Belhoe</i> of Assam, 70 feet high, cortice albido, foliis orbato,
panculis (fructus) pendulis, occurs: it has the appearance of an Amentaceous
tree.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>27th</i>.&mdash;We have remained at Bamoo; nothing
appears to have been settled below, and the river is reported to be
unsafe.&nbsp; It has fallen at least three feet since our arrival.&nbsp;
Bayfield measured the left channel yesterday; it is nearly 750 yards
wide.</p>
<p>Bamoo is situated on the left bank, along which its principal street
runs.&nbsp; The town is a very narrow one, the breadth averaging about
200 yards; its extent is considerable, but it scarcely contains 600
houses, and of these 105 are Chinese, and only has one good street,
<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. as to length.&nbsp; Neither are the houses at all
good or large, so that the population cannot be established at more
than 3000.&nbsp; I allude only to those within the stockade; out of
this, and close to Bamoo are two or three small villages.&nbsp; The
stockade is of timber, <i>pangaed</i>, or fenced outside for about 30
yards; it has just been completely repaired, as an attack is expected
from the Khukeens.</p>
<p>The Chinamen live all together, in a street of low houses built of
unbaked bricks; these are not comparable to the houses at Moulmain.&nbsp;
There is but little trade now going on.&nbsp; Within the stockade and
without, low swampy ravines occur, that cannot be but injurious to the
healthiness of the town.&nbsp; The Myoowoon spends all his money in
pagodas, none of which are worth seeing: all the roads and bridges he
leaves to take care of themselves.</p>
<p>The <i>inferior</i> <i>caked</i> <i>tea</i>, sugarcandy, silk dresses,
straw hats, and caps are procurable, but at a high price.&nbsp; Pork
is plentiful, and the bazaar is well supplied with fish.&nbsp; It is
a much more busy place than Mogoung, as well as considerably larger.&nbsp;
The chief export trade with the Chinese is cotton; the revenue however
by no means equals that of the Mogoung district.</p>
<p>The country around is nearly flat; on one side of the stockade there
is an extensive marsh well adapted for paddy.&nbsp; Otherwise the ground
is dry, and tolerably well drained; it appears to have been formerly
wooded; at present the environs are occupied by undershrubs.&nbsp; I
have observed no peculiar botanical feature.&nbsp; Among the undershrubs
are Phyllanth&aelig; 2, Apocynea arborescens, Gelonium, Combretum, Strychnos,
Vitex, Melastoma.&nbsp; When I say undershrubs, I mean that such is
their present appearance.&nbsp; The only new plant is an elegant Capparis,
subscandens, floribus albis, odoratis demum filamentisque purpureo-roseis.&nbsp;
About old Pagodas, Pladera of Moulmain, a Labiata, Stemodia, and Andropogon
occur.</p>
<p>The cultivated plants are those of the coast, Hyperanthera Moringa,
Bixa Orellana, Calotropis gigantea, Artocarpus integrifolia, a Phyllanthus,
Cordia Myxa, Carica Papaya, Citrus medica, Plantains, a large and coarse
Custard Apple, Mango, Zyziphus, Cocos, Taliera, Agati.</p>
<p>The climate is dry and sultry, the diurnal range of the Thermometer
being from 28 to 32&deg;.&nbsp; At this season, viz. at 6&frac12; A.M.
from 66 to 68; 4 P.M. from 94 to 96.&nbsp; North winds are common, daily
commencing from that quarter, or terminating there.&nbsp; They are not
accompanied by much rain, although the weather is unsettled.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;A Khukeen whom Bayfield sent for tea
returned, bringing with him many specimens out of flower.&nbsp; The
striking difference between this and the tea I have hitherto seen, consists
in the smallness and finer texture of the leaves.&nbsp; For although
a few of the specimens had leaves measuring six by three inches, yet
the generality, and these were mature, measured from four to three,
by two to three.&nbsp; As both entire and serrated leaves occur, the
finer texture was more remarkable.&nbsp; The bitterness, as well as
the peculiar flavour were most evident.&nbsp; Young leaves were abundant.</p>
<p>The Khukeens make no use of the tea.&nbsp; The Chinese here talk
of this as the jungle tea, and affirm that it cannot be manufactured
into a good article.&nbsp; They talk of the valuable sorts as being
very numerous, and all as having small leaves.&nbsp; Neither here nor
at Mogoung are there any real Chinamen, nor is there any body who understands
the process of manufacturing tea.&nbsp; The caked tea is not made to
adhere by the serum of sheep&rsquo;s blood, it adheres owing to being
thus packed before it is dry.&nbsp; The plain around Bamoo is intersected
by ravines, which afford good paddy cultivation; no large trees occur
within 1&frac12; miles of the town.&nbsp; At this distance a large Dipterocarpea
is common.&nbsp; In the underwood around the town, a Dipterocarpus,
arbuscula, foliis maximis, oblongo-cordatis, Gordonia, Lagerstr&aelig;mia
parviflora, Elodea, Nauclea; Leguminos&aelig; 3, Gelonia, Combretum,
Jasminum occur.&nbsp; In the marshes Ammannia rotundifolia, Cyrilla,
Azolla, Marsilea, and Salvinia, Serpicula, Ceratophyllum; a Campanula
<i>arenosa</i> reaches thus far.</p>
<p>Every day indecent sights occur in the river, owing to the women
bathing without clothes, and either with or near the men.&nbsp; They
appear to be indifferent to the concealment of their person, breasts,
and hoc genus omne, being freely exposed.&nbsp; They swim very well,
and in a curious way.&nbsp; They make their escape by squatting down
in the water, unfolding their cloth, and springing up behind it.&nbsp;
As for the men, they appear to take a pride in exposing every part of
their bodies.&nbsp; No gazers-on occur among these people, such not
being the fashion.</p>
<p>The Shan Tarooks who trade with this place use oxen in addition to
other beasts of burden; the breed appears good, resembling the smaller
kind of India.</p>
<p>The Irrawaddi here is between the extreme banks a little less than
1&frac12; miles broad; the channel on which Bamo is situated is the
largest, and is 800 yards across.&nbsp; Two other channels exist, of
which the west is the smallest, and carries off least water.&nbsp; The
river is a good deal sub-divided by sandbanks, but is, compared with
the Burrumpooter a confined river.&nbsp; Since our arrival here it has
sunk several (say five or six) feet, and no longer looks the noble river
it did on our arrival.</p>
<p>The sandbanks when they do exist are either naked, or clothed with
partial and not gigantic grassy vegetation.&nbsp; I have not seen any
thing comparable to the churs of the B. pooter in this respect.&nbsp;
The temperature of the river is not particularly low, and is much higher
now than during the rise.&nbsp; From Bamoo the opening of the Kioukdweng
is not conspicuous, nobody unacquainted with the course of the river
would imagine that it passes through the range of hills to the N. and
NNE.&nbsp; The highest hills visible are to the east.&nbsp; They are
within a day&rsquo;s journey, and are clothed to their summits.&nbsp;
Some appear 3000 feet high.</p>
<p>Low hills inhabited by wild Khukeens, are visible nearly all around,
except perhaps due west.&nbsp; The wild fierce nature of these people
is attended with a great extent of mischief, quite unchecked, without
eliciting even precautionary measures on the part of the Burmese Government.</p>
<p>There are a few angles in the Bamoo stockade, and these exist because
a straight line cannot be preserved; and large torches are placed out
on levers for illuminating the enemy, and loop-holes are cut through
the timbers; watch-houses are likewise placed at certain points.&nbsp;
There are two rows of <i>pangahs</i> or fences outside, but not the
Singpho pangahs.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all this the river face is quite
defenceless.</p>
<p>The soil is dry and sandy, and cultivation is carried on principally
on the churs.&nbsp; Pumpkins and Gourds are abundant; Yams, (Dioscorea,)
not very good.&nbsp; Rice is sold at the usual price, a basket full
for a rupee.&nbsp; The town is dirty, and not kept in any order.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;We left Bamoo, and in three hours reached
Kounglaun, a rather large village on the left bank, containing 100 houses,
many of which are respectable, better indeed than any in Bamoo.&nbsp;
It contains many small ruined pagodas.&nbsp; A gigantic tree grows within
the stockade, which is a very poor one.&nbsp; Punica Granatum, and Beloe,
were the only plants of interest observed in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We passed several (six or seven) villages, none except one with more
than thirty houses; the one alluded to had sixty.&nbsp; All the houses
continue small.&nbsp; The river is here much subdivided, and in many
places shallow; sandbanks are common.&nbsp; Vegetation of banks is almost
entirely Gramine&aelig;, and coarse strong-smelling Composit&aelig;.&nbsp;
The grasses are different from those previously met with, except the
Arundo.&nbsp; Rosa continues; Salix is common.&nbsp; Between Koungloung
and Tsenkan, which is on the same bank, and close to the entrance to
the Kioukdweng, three villages are met with; but none of any size.&nbsp;
Tsenkan is prettily situated on a high bank, or rather low hill.&nbsp;
The houses are about 100 in number, all poor and small.&nbsp; The stockade
is a miserable affair.&nbsp; There are some good Poonghie houses, and
a very pretty group of pagodas on a small rock.&nbsp; The country is
jungly; just above the town a nullah enters the Irrawaddi: it is down
this that large quantities of teak is brought, from hills two days&rsquo;
journey to the eastward; some large rafts were seen, but although some
of the timbers were stout, none were of any great size.&nbsp; I gathered
a pretty Hippocrateaceous plant in the jungles, as well as a Combretum;
a Vitex, an Amyridea, etc.&nbsp; Phrynium dichotomum occurs here; Rosa
continues; Jatropha is cultivated.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;Started at 5 A.M., and entered the Kioukdweng
almost immediately.&nbsp; We halted about 7, at Tsenbo.&nbsp; Noticed
&AElig;sculus, Sisymbrium, Campanula, Adelia nereifolia, Dillania speciosa,
the usual Composit&aelig;, and largish Dipterocarpe&aelig;.&nbsp; The
river is a good deal narrowed, but never less than 130 yards across,
and as there are no rocks in any direction to impede the stream, the
water flows but slowly and very placidly.&nbsp; Almost all the rocks
forming the hills are grey carbonate of lime.&nbsp; These hills are
covered to high-water mark, with scanty somewhat stunted trees, the
most of which have no foliage.&nbsp; The scenery is by no means so bold
as in the upper K. dweng, although just above Tsenbo, there is a noble
cliff, 300 feet high, and almost perpendicular; under its ledges we
observed great numbers of bees&rsquo; nests.&nbsp; The rock when exposed
is rather greyish black, and in many places reddish.&nbsp; Serpentine
occurs, but is not common.&nbsp; A good deal of lime is prepared in
this Kioukdweng, and some portions of it in the rugged serrated appearance,
remind one of the limestone cliffs on the coast.&nbsp; Above Tsenbo
and nearly opposite the cliff, is a small village of eight houses.&nbsp;
Tsenbo numbers fifteen; it is on the left bank, and is a miserable place.&nbsp;
Here we were left by our escort which accompanied us from Tsenkan, and
the Thogee refused positively to give us two or three men to row.&nbsp;
Although master of a miserable hole, he had made preparations for defence,
and had set on foot a custom house.&nbsp; We saw a good many boats passing
up, all evidently containing families moving away from their villages.</p>
<p>In this Kioukdweng a fine Palm exists, which I have never seen before.&nbsp;
Caudex 10-15 pedalis, crassa, petiolorum basibus processibus vestitis,
frondibus pinnatis, 10 pedalibus, pinnis ensifornibus 2 to 2&frac12;
pedalibus, subtus glaucis, diametro 1&frac12; uncialibus, basi valde
obliquis, bilobis! lobo inferiore maximo, decurrenti, uninervi: floribus
in spadicibus nutanti-curvatis, amplis, basi spathaceis spicato-paniculatis.&nbsp;
Florib. masculis polyandris.</p>
<p>Petiol. bases cretos&aelig;, intus processubus atris, subulatis,
longissimis robustis quasi panicillatis.</p>
<p>Habitus quodammodo Wallichi&aelig;.&nbsp; Hab. in Umbrosissimis.</p>
<p>An arbuscula Anonacea, floribus dioicis, Mas. coroll&aelig; petalis

<p>Arrived at Kioukgyee at 5 P.M.&nbsp; Waited on and dined with the
Meewoon, who is a gentlemanly, spare, lively man with grey hair.&nbsp;
Dinner was good, and clean.&nbsp; Preserved dried jujubes from China,
as well as some preserved by himself were very good.&nbsp; Kioukgyee
is on the right bank of the river, which is here undivided by islands,
and about 1200 yards broad.&nbsp; Just above the town there are some
rocks.&nbsp; The number of houses is about eighty-five, most of them
arranged in a broad street running along the river, and the best that
I have seen for some time.</p>
<p>The village is surrounded by a new and wretched stockade, the outskirts
being fenced or <i>pangaed</i>; the people are on the qui vive, and
the whole village seems to be in a constant state of alarm.&nbsp; All
the jungle immediately adjoining the town is cut down; many of the houses
are unroofed, and all the gates are guarded.&nbsp; Visited this morning
the lines occupied by the attacking force; these were not 300 yards
from the village, and occupied the skirts of the jungle: trees had been
felled and earth thrown up, but not in such a manner as to obstruct
in any way tolerably brave men.&nbsp; We saw none of the slain, we may
therefore doubt if there were any, but it was evident from platters,
etc. strewed about, that the flight of the robbers had been very precipitate.&nbsp;
We passed some little distance above this, a holy island, the numberless
small pagodas on which, had a very pretty effect.&nbsp; Close to these
there was a small village, Sheweygyoo, which had been just burnt down
by the Kioukgyee people, for giving assistance to the robbers; this
as well as two other contiguous villages before occupied a good extent
of the left bank, and numbered probably 150 houses.&nbsp; Most of the
inhabitants have retreated up the river.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>8th</i>.&mdash;Reached Katha at 6 P.M.&nbsp; Throughout
the day saw little of interest.&nbsp; What we did see, gave evident
tokens of disturbances,: villages deserted; dogs starved, howling piteously;
canoes without owners.&nbsp; At one village a few miles below Kioukgit,
our arrival caused much excitement, and a gun was fired off as a signal
of alarm on our approach.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Katha is on the right bank of the Irrawaddi;
it is situated on an eminence, and commands a fine view of a fine reach
of the river; the situation indeed is excellent.&nbsp; It contains nearly
200 houses, but these are not of the better description.&nbsp; To the
west is a fine chain of hills, the lowest ranges of which are distant
about one mile and a half; the highest peaks are perhaps 1500 feet.&nbsp;
No signs of alarm or disturbances are here visible, although part of
the force that invested Kioukgit came from this village.&nbsp; We here
learn the agreeable news that the country below is quiet, and that no
robbers now infested the road.&nbsp; The Thogee is a fine looking young
man; very polite.&nbsp; This village boasts of some pretty pagodas,
well grouped, and a very fine <i>Kiown</i>, the workmanship of which
astonished me, particularly the carving; it is built of teak, the posts
being very stout, and very numerous.&nbsp; Several merchant boats left
before us, apparently anxious for our escort.</p>
<p>Behind the town is a large plain used for the cultivation of paddy.&nbsp;
Otherwise the jungle comes close to the houses, although the larger
trees have been felled for firewood, etc.: the woods are dry, and tolerably
open.&nbsp; In the morning I went out towards the hills; the chief timber
trees are a fine Dipterocarpus, and a Hopea; Pentapetes likewise occurs;
Terminalia Chebula.&nbsp; Gathered a fine Arum, somewhat like A. campanulatum.&nbsp;
An arboreous Gardenia, as at Mergui; Myrtacea, Vitex, Bauhinia of yesterday;
Randia, Andropogon aciculare; some stunted bamboos were likewise observed.&nbsp;
Altogether Katha is the prettiest place I have yet seen.&nbsp; The river
opposite it is confined to one bed, about 500 yards broad.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Left at 7 A.M., and reached the mouth
of the Shwe Lee at 1 P.M.; the distance according to B. being sixteen
miles.&nbsp; Passed a few villages, but none of any size; the houses
of all continue of the same description.&nbsp; The river presents the
same features.&nbsp; Salix continues.&nbsp; Sandbanks occupied by annual
Composit&aelig; occur, two Polygona, Campanula, a Ranunculus, much like
that of Suddiya, a Labiata, Paronychia, two Spermacoces; Bombax occurs
just below Katha; Salix and Rosa continue.&nbsp; Shwe Lee is a considerable
river, at the mouth between 4 and 500 yards broad; but one-third of
this is unoccupied by water, and the stream is not deep, although of
the ordinary strength.&nbsp; Above, it narrows considerably.</p>
<p>7&frac12; P.M.&nbsp; Temperature of the air 76&deg;.&nbsp; Of Irrawaddi
74&deg;.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Tsa-gaiya.&nbsp; This is a mean village
on the left bank, about eighteen miles from Katha; it is close to a
low range of hills, and occupies part of a plain, which is adapted for
paddy cultivation.&nbsp; Near the village to the North, is a small <i>jeel</i>,
covered to a great extent with a large Scirpus, Jussi&aelig;a, Azolla,
Salvinia, etc.&nbsp; Water-fruits are abundant; round this paddy is
cultivated, and they appear to cut it at this time.&nbsp; Low ground
near the jeel is covered with a low, handsome Stravadium or Barringtonia,
as well as a Xanthophyllum, resembling exceedingly in appearance a Leguminosa:
the wood is hard.&nbsp; Calamus is also common.&nbsp; A handsome Nauclea
occurs, and on the grassy margins of the plain a small Euphrasia is
common.</p>
<p>During our stage I observed large quantities of Bombax, and a tree
apparently the Beloe of Assam; the banks were either grassy or wooded,
especially on the right bank, which is skirted entirely by hills of
the same barren looking description.&nbsp; The grasses are all small
compared with those of Assam.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;Reached Tagoung late in the evening
at 7&frac12;: distance thirty-two miles.&nbsp; The river continues the
same; the hills on the left bank are much broken into ravines: all continue
clothed with the same stunted vegetation.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>11th</i>.&mdash;Tagoung is a miserable village on the
left bank; it occupies a rocky eminence, and contains less than 100
houses.&nbsp; It is the most inferior village I have yet seen, the streets
being dreadfully dirty and the houses very mean.&nbsp; We visited an
old pagoda, about a mile from the town, which is surrounded by an antique
wall, much obscured by jungle, and more resembling a bund.&nbsp; On
our route hither we landed at Thigan, a village containing about forty
houses, and prettily situated at the foot of a hill of micaceous sandstone,
on the right bank.&nbsp; At this place are the remains of a fort built
by the Chinese, of slabs of the rock forming the hill.&nbsp; Similar
remains exist at Myadoung, on the opposite bank, as I learn from Mr.
Bayfield.&nbsp; I gathered a Sida, Capparis, Prionitis, Gnaphalium,
and a Xanthoxylia petiolis alatis armata; an Adiantum grows between
the slabs composing the wall.&nbsp; At Tsenkan I observed an Agave,
a different Cactus, a fleshy Euphorbia; and an Ananassa is common all
about.</p>
<p>About Tagoung the botany is varied, and interesting.&nbsp; I gathered
about fifteen plants that had not occurred before, two Po&aelig;, two
Andropogons, a Zanthoxylum, and an Olax.&nbsp; The most interesting
is an Apocynea, floribus infundibulifor. lamina reflexa, fauce squamis
dentatis 10, serie duplici dispositis, interioribus petalis oppositis
et majoribus, antheris, in conum stigma omnino coadunatis.&nbsp; Cotton
cultivated here; plants taller than usual.&nbsp; The villages around
are all forsaken owing to one of them having been attacked by Khukeens,
and two men carried off.&nbsp; Hence the population at Tagoung, although
usually scanty, is now much increased from adjoining places.&nbsp; A
small river falls into the Irrawaddi immediately above Tagoung.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>12th</i>.&mdash;Reached Mal&eacute; about 6 P.M.&nbsp;
Passed <i>en</i> <i>route</i> a few villages, none of any size or importance.&nbsp;
The river varies in width, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. the channel, from 400
to 600 yards.&nbsp; The banks are either alluvial or rocky; and there
are hills on the right bank skirting the river; those on the left, are
more distant and higher.&nbsp; Borassus commences to be common; it is
a taller, and more slender tree than that of Coromandel, and the trunk
is not covered with the persistent bases of the petioles.</p>
<p>The village of Tsebainago is opposite to Mal&eacute;, and appears
nearly of the same size.&nbsp; Both are situated close to the mouth
of the third Kioukdweng.&nbsp; Mal&eacute; contains 150 houses, all
small; it is a place of no trade.&nbsp; To the north is a hill forming
the river bank, and covered with pagodas; it is the prettiest place
we observed after Katha.&nbsp; The soil has now put on the dry sterile
appearance of the Coromandel coast, all the trees of which, except the
figs, are common; and often render the banks very pretty.&nbsp; Tectona
of Hamilton is very common; it is a tree not exceeding in height 40
feet, much resembling in habit the more valuable species; the flowers
are blueish, particularly the villi; the leaves have the same excessive
rough feel.&nbsp; Two other Verbenace&aelig;, a curious Capparidea,
caule laxo, foliis lineari-oblongis, basi hastato-cordatis, and a Ximenia
are common.&nbsp; On the banks Stravadium, and an arboreous Butea, a
Combretum, are common.&nbsp; Low stunted bamboos likewise prevail; and
all the bushes are prickly.&nbsp; Nyctanthes is cultivated.&nbsp; The
rocks as well as those forming the Kioukdweng, are of coarse sandstone,
here and there affording nourishment to abortive Composit&aelig;, stunted
grasses, Mollugo, etc.</p>
<p>Left Mal&eacute;, and entered immediately the last Kioukdweng on
descending, or the first defile on ascending against the stream.&nbsp;
This is a pretty passage, and moreover has no dangerous places; the
hills are low, lower than those of the two former passes, consisting
of sandstone partially clothed with the same scanty vegetation, presenting
the same barren appearance.&nbsp; Olax, Fici, Leguminosa, stunted bamboos,
Hippocrateacea, Mimosa, and Stravadium, occur.&nbsp; Celsia on sandy
spots, together with Campanula, but this last is becoming rare.&nbsp;
Adelia nereifolia continues.&nbsp; An arundo occurs on the naked rocks;
Cassia fistula, Tectona Hamiltoniana are also present.</p>
<p>We are much impeded by south-west winds; and owing to this and the
slowness of the stream, we were compelled to remain some time at Thee-ha-dau.&nbsp;
We there had excellent opportunities of seeing the fish, which are so
very tame as to come up to the sides of the boat, and even to allow
themselves to be handled.&nbsp; The faqueers of the place call them
together; but I think they are not much disposed to come from mere calling,
for they seem to require more substantial proofs of being wanted, in
the shape of food: they are found in still water in a small bay, which
is closed up still more from the influence of the stream by a round
island, constructed superficially on a rocky base, and on which pagodas
are built.&nbsp; They resemble a good deal the Gooroa Mas of Assam,
but have no large teeth as this has.&nbsp; They are very greedy, of
a blueish grey colour, occasionally inclining to red; the feelers are
in some forked: they have no scales.</p>
<p>We continued our course when the wind lulled; halted to dine on a
sandbank, and proceeded on afterwards, until we reached Kabuct about
8&frac12; P.M.&nbsp; On the sandbank where we dined I gathered a Crotalaria,
Campanula, Cleome, a Graminea, Polygonum, Cyperace&aelig;, and a Dentelloidea.&nbsp;
The villages seen were all small.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>13th</i>.&mdash;Left Kabuct before 6.&nbsp; Halted
to breakfast on a steep bank, finding it impossible to proceed against
the south-west winds, which have now become prevalent.</p>
<p>At this place, which is hilly, I gathered Gmelina villosa, an Anonacea,
calyce 6 sepalis, cor. tripetala, pet. patentissimis, margine revolutis,
luteis.&nbsp; A Carissa, Grewia, Malpighiacea samaris, 3-alatis, alis
dorsalibus abbreviatis, a curious Graminea, a green Orchidea, terrestris,
bulbosa, flore ante folia evoluta, a Diospyros, Polygala, Plectranthus,
Rungia, Pladera, etc.</p>
<p>Halted at Movo, owing to the wind.&nbsp; This is a very pretty village;
of no great size, and of no importance.&nbsp; A delightful tope formed
by Mango, Fig, and Garcinia, or Xanthochymus, the dense shade of which
is most agreeable; Averrhoa, &AElig;gle Marmelos is cultivated here;
Borassus is common, trunks of which are often of very irregular diameter.&nbsp;
Low grassy places occur running along the back of the village, with
abundance of a Combretum fruticosum; and a nullah at either end of the
village presents many trees on its banks, particularly a very large
and handsome Myrtacea, Hemarthria compressa.&nbsp; Stravadium racemis
longe pendulis.</p>
<p>We were compelled to put into Mal&aacute; on the right bank, about
a mile above Tsengoo, by a severe storm from the north-west.&nbsp; This
village consists of about forty houses, many pagodas, and has a good
many potteries, and some fine trees.&nbsp; It is at the entrance of
the Kioukdweng.&nbsp; Observed Jatropha Curcas, and Vitex negrendo.&nbsp;
In the evening we proceeded to Tsenbou.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Left Tsenbou, and breakfasted at Nbat
Kiown-wa.&nbsp; Just above this are several villages, two of which number
nearly seventy houses each.&nbsp; This is the most populous part I have
seen.&nbsp; To the east of this are the Ruby mines in the Shan hills;
and to the south-east low hills from which the marble is procured, from
which they make the idols.&nbsp; The river features continue the same;
namely, low hills close to the right bank, and more distant as well
as higher ones on the left.&nbsp; On the Shan hills to the east, teak
forests occur; on those to the west, tea also grows.&nbsp; In Polong
tea districts also occur; but the tea is very coarse, and said not to
be drinkable.&nbsp; Hemarthria, and Hoya viridiflora were found.</p>
<p>Here I found Solanum, Tribulus, a Mimosa, lime trees, Carissa, Mimusops,
Stemodia ruderalis now appear.&nbsp; The most interesting is a small
diffuse Caryoplylleous-looking plant, with white Campanulate flowers;
it is probably a Frankeniacea.&nbsp; On the pagodas an Aristella grows.&nbsp;
Certain features prevail in the vegetation similar to those of the Coromandel
coast.&nbsp; Fig trees often surrounded at base with brick-work; this
never lasts long, the roots tearing up the masonry in every direction.</p>
<p>The exit from this 3rd Kioukdweng is very pretty.&nbsp; Tsengru with
its numerous white pagodas; the noble river expanded into a broad bay;
the Eastern hills are very beautiful, and the Marble hills which form
a background to Tsenbou are no less so.&nbsp; The banks towards the
exit from the defile are sloping, often covered with grass.&nbsp; The
Palmyra trees and Fig trees have a very pleasing effect.&nbsp; At Kiougyoung
there is a large brick fort, built by Alompras.&nbsp; The village contains
about 150 houses: no large village is passed between this and Kubuct.</p>
<p>Halted above Sheemnaga to look at Gaudama&rsquo;s foot, a piece of
workmanship contained in a pagoda; it is a very large foot, with a central
circular impression.&nbsp; This is about a mile below Endawka.&nbsp;
Sheemnaga never contained more than 400 houses, I counted upwards of
180, and although extensive traces of fire, and of new houses existed,
I should reckon it to have contained only about 300.&nbsp; At the Pagoda
I gathered a curious Rutaceous-looking decandrous thorny tree, with
foliis bijugis.</p>
<p>Reached Mengoon about 7 P.M.&nbsp; Landed at the commencement of
the sandstone hills, which in some places assume the form of cliffs:
texture very loose.&nbsp; They are full of holes, and abound with blue
rock Pigeons.&nbsp; Gathered a Murraya.&nbsp; Trichodesma indicus and
Composit&aelig;, Asclepiadea, Calotropis gigantea, and a curious Arenariod-looking
plant.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>15th</i>.&mdash;Mengoon boasts of a huge unfinished
Pagoda, consisting as it now stands of an immense square brick mass,
surrounded by four fine broad raised terraces; it would have been, had
it been finished, upwards of 700 feet high.&nbsp; The dome was to have
been with angular sides.&nbsp; Height 170 feet; the basement, as may
be supposed, is immense.&nbsp; The plan or model of it was first built
in a small adjoining grove to the south, by the grandfather of the present
king.&nbsp; The whole kingdom must have been occupied in its erection.&nbsp;
The entrance to it is guarded by two huge Griffins.&nbsp; Several large
bells lie close to it.&nbsp; The country around is hilly; the hills
low, raviny, and clothed with stunted vegetation.&nbsp; Beautiful topes
exist along the river bank, between this and the cliffs before alluded
to; consisting chiefly of fine mango trees, noble Fici likewise occur.&nbsp;
About Mengoon, Jatropha Curcas is common.&nbsp; Gymnemea, Calatropis
gigantea, and Argemone abound.&nbsp; We found a Pergularia, Lippia,
Zyzyphus, and one or two small Euphorbiace&aelig;.&nbsp; The soil is
dry, sandy, and barren.</p>
<p>We reached Ava about 1 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>21st</i>.&mdash;Went to Tsegai on an excursion: the
hills in this vicinity are low, none exceeding 300 or 400 feet, dry
and barren, chiefly composed of grey carbonate of lime, and in some
places Kancha occurs.&nbsp; Pagodas are very numerous, but none are
very large, or bearing the stamp of great age.&nbsp; A fine view of
country is however afforded: large plains are seen to the east of the
city, and between the hills and the river two large jheels are visible
from the hills.</p>
<p>The vegetation almost entirely consists of low stunted, very ramous
shrubs, and these are generally thorny.&nbsp; Not a tree visible except
Bombax and Tamarindus, but this last is planted.&nbsp; A large subarboreous
Cactus, spinosus, ramis 4 angulis, is common.&nbsp; Noticed four species
of Capparis, and the following plants, Barleria, Prionitis, Tamarindus,
&AElig;gle, Zizyphus, Cocos; Borassus, Bixa, Cordia, Punica, Ricinus,
Melia Azederak; Citrus Cassia, near houses and on the hills; Euphorbia
2, Ximenia, Cleome, Boerhaavia, Adhatode, Cassia sennoidea, Sid&aelig;,
Andropogon, a lax Linaria common on old pagodas; Calanchoe, Sedum, Pommereulla,
Vinca rosea, Tectona Hamiltoniana, but not of such size as at Mal&eacute;.&nbsp;
Bambusa stunted and rare, Blepharacanthus, Polygala, Labiat&aelig; 2,
&AElig;ru&aelig;, sp. Fici one or two, an Alstonia, Celosia mollugo,
Solani sp. Stemodia, Combretum, Heliotropium indicum, and the Euphorbiacea
of Mengwong.&nbsp; It will at once be seen that the vegetation has some
similarity with that of the Carnatic, for in addition I found Asplenium
radiatum, and Limonea Monophylla, a Carissa, Ximenia, Flacourtia, etc.
etc.</p>
<p>Ava is a fine town, surrounded with an excellent brick wall: the
streets are wide, and kept clean; the houses are regular, and as trees
are interspersed, a pleasing effect is produced.&nbsp; The appearance
is much improved by a lattice before each house.&nbsp; The houses also
are of a superior description, a few only are of brick.&nbsp; The fort
is surrounded by an additional wall, and a broad but shallow ditch.&nbsp;
The palace is a handsome, irregular, gilt edifice; but its precincts
are not kept so clean as they might be.&nbsp; The Shwottoo is a handsome
hall.&nbsp; The town altogether conveys an idea of importance.&nbsp;
The river is about 800 yards broad opposite the Residency; but above,
it is encroached on by a sandbank.&nbsp; Boats are numerous, and opposite
Tsegain there is a busy ferry, especially now the king is at Tsegain.&nbsp;
This is a much preferable place, and rendered much more pleasing by
its superb Tamarind trees, with their most elegant foliage and sculptured
trunks.&nbsp; The plants cultivated about Ava are Palmyra, Cocoa (rare).&nbsp;
Tamarinds abound; Carica Papaya, Punica Granatum; Mangoes, which are
of good description; Cordia, Plantains, &AElig;gle Marmelos.</p>
<p>The country is flat, and destitute of trees to the south and southwest.&nbsp;
The whole of this is cultivated during the rains, chiefly for Gram,
Tobacco, Capsicum, and a Melilotus.&nbsp; At present the plains are
barren, the low places being almost exclusively occupied by a Combretum;
the rest give a new Polygonum, Lippia, 2 or 3 Composit&aelig;, and a
curious dwarf grass.&nbsp; On the walls Linaria is common.&nbsp; Noticed
near one of the gates, Cryptostegia grandiflora; the waste places and
banks are occupied by Argemone, Mollugine&aelig; three, Xanthium, Dentella,
and low annual Composit&aelig;.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>26th</i>.&mdash;Visited Tsegain in the evening, and
returned to Ava on the following morning.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>27th</i>.&mdash;Noticed Ph&oelig;nix sylvestris.&nbsp;
The Euphorbia is common; it is not a Cactus, but a species of this genus,
ramis complanatis, is found though not common; as well as an Agave or
Aloe, but this is a doubtful native.&nbsp; Poinciana pulcherrima, both
red and yellow, Rhus? sp. arbuscula, Vallaris solanacea.&nbsp; A small
Lycopodium, Gmelina asiatica?&nbsp; The additional Madras plants are,
Cissus quadrangularis.&nbsp; There is likewise another fleshy species
fol. 3 phyllis, Sarcostemma viminale, Indigofera, Kalanch&oelig; laciniata
is common; so is the white Cyperacea on barren spots!&nbsp; I met with
Sarcostemma ciliatum; Wall.? petalis extus viridescent, intus ciliisque
purpuro sanguinies, but it is rare.&nbsp; Cardiospermum pubescens is
certainly distinct, the flowers are twice as large as those of C. Halicacabum,
fructibus inflatis vix alatis, ovalibus, dehiscentia septicida, septis
axi adnatis, persistentibus.&nbsp; Semin. solitarii centro loculi affixis,
pisiparvi magnitudine, atris.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p><i>Botanical</i> <i>notes</i> <i>connected</i> <i>with</i> <i>the</i>
<i>foregoing</i> <i>Journal</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>February</i> <i>19th</i>.&mdash;The finest view of the hills
from Upper Assam is obtained on a reach or turn of the river just above
Palankar, the river bending to the NNE.&nbsp; Snow is plentifully seen
on one back range from the Sugar-loaf peak.&nbsp; Another reach shortly
after presents a fine view of the Burrampooter chasm, terminated by
the rugged peak so distinctly seen from Suddiyah, due east.&nbsp; This
view might be chosen, as a general characteristic of the Scenery of
Upper Assam.</p>
<p>It embraces the Mishmee mountains to the left, the higher peaks of
which are covered with perpetual snow.&nbsp; These lie to the NNE. of
Beesa.&nbsp; To the east, is the continuation of the Himalaya, to the
South-east and South, the Patkaye, and Naga ranges; the whole forming
a panorama, rarely if any where surpassed in beauty.&nbsp; Temperature.
of the river at 6 A.M. 67&deg;</p>
<p><i>Musa</i>.&nbsp; Many flowers from the axil of a bract; no bractioles
interspersed, hence we may expect racemose or spicate partial inflorescences.&nbsp;
The perianth is unilateral, 5 cleft, the two smaller segments, which
are intermediate, being internal, or belonging to a different series.&nbsp;
Within this petaloid perianth is a membranous one, together with a boat-shaped
bracteolate body, entire.&nbsp; The stamens are five, evidently opposite
to the segments of the petaloid perianth, staminibus adnatis, the sixth
is not developed, but is rudimentary, and exceedly minute, opposite
to the bracteoid body.&nbsp; The carpella three, alternate as they ought
to be with the last series of stamina, and hence they are opposed to
the larger and outer segments of the petaloid perianth, but this last
point deserves further examination.</p>
<p>The base of the bracteoid sepal is filled with a gelatinous, sweet,
transparent, unicoloured &frac12; fluid.</p>
<p>I am unaware whether this explanation has occurred to any body else.</p>
<p>It is curious as compared with Scitamine&aelig;, in which the posticous
stamen is alone fully developed.&nbsp; Pl. 1. Fig. 3. <i>a</i>. bracteoid
body, <i>b</i>. sterile stamen, c.c.c. outer series, d.d. inner ditto.</p>
<p>The fact of the outer smaller lacini&aelig; belonging to a second
series is not very apparent, but is corroborated by the evidently internal
situation of the bracteoid scale, and by the evidently elevated lines
visible in the inner.</p>
<p>(<i>April</i> <i>3rd</i>, <i>1837</i>.&mdash;On march towards the
Serpentine mines) the face of the perianth, corresponds to these smaller
lacini&aelig;.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;Thunbergia grandiflora has the pedicels
of its flowers twisted, or not twisted, according to the situation of
the flowers.&nbsp; Thus if the flower be so situated that the raceme
has the direction of the axis, or in other words is erect, the pedicel
is straight, but if the raceme, as generally happens, be pendulous,
the twisting of the pedicel is resorted to, to secure the flower that
situation which it would have, were the raceme erect.</p>
<p>The above is obvious in flowers which from elongation of the axis
of inflorescence, have fasciculate or aggregate flowers.&nbsp; An obvious
inference is, that the twisting of the pedicel is not of generic, nor
of specific importance; and that it is capable of being produced artificially.</p>
<p>This resupination is not uncommon in the order; it is most evident
in Thunbergia coccinea, in which the racemes are always pendulous.&nbsp;
There is nothing, at least in this species, in the situation of the
genitalia to account for the resupination.</p>
<p>Pedicelli demum apicem infra articulati, the inflorescence of this
order is always centrifugal, the partial axis being invariably as well
indeed as the general, disposed to dichotomy.&nbsp; Hence the very common
presence of three bracte&aelig; to each flower, the central one presenting
the leaf from whose axil the partial branch springs.</p>
<p>Stipul&aelig;&mdash;if the analogy of these be difficult to ascertain,
the structure and functions would appear to be as of leaves, in addition
to the function of protection.&nbsp; In most cases they are certainly
not double organs; in Naucleace&aelig; they are apparently so.&nbsp;
Can this be explained by supposing them to form a bud with four scales,
the scales instead of being imbricate, being on one plane.&nbsp; Stipell&aelig;
of Leguminos&aelig; are certainly single; these being all probably stipulate
plants, are to be considered as having terminal buds, the buds being
either totally, or partially protected by the stipul&aelig;.&nbsp; The
difficult nature of ochre&aelig; of Polygone&aelig; is certainly to
be acknowledged, but they are similar to those of Costus, and hence
not stipul&aelig;, but an extension of the margin of the vaginate petiole,
from which veins are prolonged into it; the functions of these are not
stomatose, since they are membranous, the veins being the only green
parts.</p>
<p>I see no reason why the stipul&aelig; of Ros&aelig; are not to be
considered as belonging to, or dilatations of the petiole.&nbsp; They
have no distinct vascular fascicles to indicate a distinct origin.&nbsp;
And further, in Lowea no stipul&aelig; exist.</p>

The situation of the stamens is somewhat obscure, the two lowermost

sub-opposite.</p>
<p>Of course if they be opposed, the perianth will be referrible to
a calyx if not to a corolla.</p>

<p>The stipul&aelig; of Ficus obviously belong not to the leaves, their
insertion taking place &frac12; a line above that of the petiole.&nbsp;
Hence they belong as obviously to the elongation of the axis above the
leaf; their coloration is curious, especially as they are green when
young.&nbsp; Their vernation is conduplicate and plicate.</p>
<p><i>Combretum</i> presents several points in common with Rhamne&aelig;;
valvate calyx, and tendency to want of petals; to El&aelig;agne&aelig;
in calyx and furfuraceous scales; a decandrous Rhamne&aelig; would differ
but little in flowers from Combretum.</p>
<p><i>My</i> <i>idea</i> of the origin of stigmata is proved to be correct
by a Phyllanthus, the carpella of which are ovuliferous below, the upper
part being fleshy, the stigmata are two to each, obviously corresponding
to the placentary inflexions, while the sinus terminating the dorsal
suture is totally naked; it is this which should bear the stigma if
Lindley&rsquo;s view were correct.</p>
<p>The true place of Moringa seems to be near Xanthophyllum with which
genus it has some remarkable points of resemblance, witness the papilionaceous
corolla; unilocular stamina, their situation, ovary, placentation, and
lastly glandulation.</p>
<p>To this Lindley has made an approximation by placing the order near
Violarie&aelig;.&nbsp; Its chief difference from Polygale&aelig;, is
habit, foliation, and the perigynous insertion of corolla and stamina,
and consequent union of the sepals.&nbsp; As in Xanthophyllum there
is no albumen.</p>

a Leguminosa.)</p>

<p>In Jonesia, there are no petals.&nbsp; Humboldtia comes near Tamarindus,
through H. Brunonis, which agrees in calyx and petals.</p>
<p>Thorns of Prionites, what are they?&nbsp; They are axillary, and
yet buds are produced between them and the axis.&nbsp; They have no
connection with the leaves.&nbsp; Were it not for the buds above alluded
to, I should say that they were abortive branches (bearing one pair
of leaves) reduced to spines.</p>
<p><i>Olacine&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; Certainly in habit, corolla, etc. Olacine&aelig;
are allied to Aurantiace&aelig;, but they are nearer akin to Santalace&aelig;.&nbsp;
The processes are indubitably modified stamina, with a great tendency
to irregularity; in one species from Tagoung only three fertile, and
five sterile stamina were observed: the three fertile generally, but
not invariably, alternate with the petals.</p>
<p>To Santalace&aelig; they approach in processes, valvate corolla,
and placentation, also to Loranthace&aelig;.</p>
<p>Eight stamina thus accounted for; when two opposed to petals, belong
to outer series&mdash;also single one.</p>
<p>In Punica, the structure of the ovaria is highly curious.&nbsp; We
find the bottom of the tube is occupied by two cells, partially filled
with ovula, which are attached both to the axis and to the base, as
well as to the lower part of the outer paries of each cell; so far,
it does not depart from the order, for in Aplexus the placentation is
tolerably similar.</p>
<p>Above these two, are 4-5 cells, filled with ovula, which are attached
entirely to the outer wall of each cell, but the placent&aelig; however
would seem to have an obvious connexion with the axis, although this
is very doubtful.</p>
<p>The formation of the stigma decidedly indicates a binary formation
of carpella.</p>
<p>If these 4 upper cells are 4 constantly, and the base of the ovary
is as constantly two celled, then the explanation is sufficiently obvious,
though different from that given by Lindley. <a name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113">{113}</a></p>
<p>First, we have in the bottom from which the mere structure of an
ovary is deduced, the normal dicarpellary structure, and there is in
addition a tendency in excess toward a parietal placentation.</p>
<p>The anomalous formation arises first from parietal placent&aelig;
being produced to the axis, and from spurious growth from the sides
of the ovary also meeting in the axis, by which the ovula are divided
into four bundles.</p>
<p>Lindley&rsquo;s view seems to be questionable, because as in all
cases the styles and stigmata are more permanent than ovaries, there
should be as many styles, etc. as ovaries.&nbsp; 2nd, because according
to this view the placental suture of the carpella would be turned from
the axis, (look at Pomace&aelig;,) although his view of Pomace&aelig;
being right would indicate an additional affinity with Mespilus, etc.
which it does in habit and abbreviated lateral branches.</p>
<p>Are all Myrtace&aelig; dicarpellar?</p>
<p>The true nature of the case is pointed out in the instance cited
by Lindley of a permanent variety of apple, which has 14 cells and 14
styles!&nbsp; With regard to Nicotiana and Nolana; have these one or
two rows of carpella?</p>

<p>The fruit of Lagerstramia grandiflora can, I think, be explained
by assuming it to consist of several carpella, which by not becoming
united near the axis, leave an irregular shaped space in the centre;
the placent&aelig; are fleshy, the ovule inserted all around.&nbsp;
This view does not take into consideration the situation of the stigmata.&nbsp;
The deeper sulci visible externally correspond to the inflexions of
the carpellary leaves; in addition to this, the centre of the dorsum
of each of these is marked with a line. <a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114">{114}</a>)</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<p><i>Report</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>Government</i> <i>of</i> <i>India</i>,
<i>12th</i> <i>July</i>, <i>1837</i>.</p>
<p>In the following report, I have divided the marches into series,
corresponding with the countries through which they were made, reserving
a table of the whole for a subsequent part.&nbsp; These series will
be as follows&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; From Sadiya to Beesa Lacoom.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; From Beesa Lacoom to Namtusseek.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; From Namtuseek to Wullabhoom.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; From Wullabhoom to Mogoung.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; From Mogoung to Ava.</p>
<h4>I.&nbsp; FROM SADIYA TO BEESA LACOOM.</h4>
<p>COUNTRY TRAVERSED BELONGING TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, AND FORMING
PART OF THE SOUTH-EAST EXTREMITY OF THE VALLEY OF ASSAM.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; From Sadiya to the Noa Dihing river mouth or Mookh.&nbsp;
Direction east.&nbsp; Distance 6 miles performed in boat, the course
lying up the Burrumpootur.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; From Noa Dihing Mookh to Rangagurrah on the Noa Dihing.&nbsp;
Direction SSE.&nbsp; Distance 12 miles, course lying along the dry bed
of the Noa Dihing.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; From Rangagurrah to Moodoa Mookh, on the same river.&nbsp;
Direction south-east, the distance being 12 miles. <a name="citation115a"></a><a href="#footnote115a">{115a}</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; From Moodoa Mookh to Kidding.&nbsp; Direction south, the
distance 9 miles, course south-east, along the bed of the Noa Dihing
as far as Wakhet, thence diverging to SSW. through heavy jungle.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; From Kidding to Namroop Puthar.&nbsp; Direction, nearly
south, the distance being 12 miles, course lying through very heavy
jungle, crosses the Karam Panee, <a name="citation115b"></a><a href="#footnote115b">{115b}</a>
which here is not fordable, and another considerable feeder of the Booree
Dihing, and lastly up the Namroop.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; From Namroop Puthar to Beesa Lacoom.&nbsp; Direction southwest,
the distance 12 miles, the course extending at first over low hills
and difficult ground, thence through heavy jungle intersected by narrow
plains, lastly chiefly along the banks of the Darap Panee.</p>
<p><i>Nature</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>country</i>.&mdash;It will
be seen that with the exception of the three first marches, and part
of the fourth, the country is occupied by the heavy jungle so prevalent
in these parts.&nbsp; The chief difficulties our party experienced arose
from the limited manner in which the jungle had been cut for their passage.</p>
<p><i>Rivers</i>.&mdash;The only one not fordable in the above route,
is the Karam Panee, but this does not hold good either above or below
the place I crossed.&nbsp; They all discharge much water during the
rains, and even in the dry season are navigable for small canoes.</p>
<p><i>Villages</i>.&mdash;These are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>Digalo</i> <i>Gohain</i> <i>Goung</i>.&mdash;On the right
bank of the Noa Dihing it is inhabited by Kamptees lately settled in
our territory, and is a respectable village.&nbsp; The Noa Dihing here
ceases to be navigable even for small canoes.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Wakhet</i>.&mdash;This is a new but wretched village,
inhabited by Singphos.&nbsp; Wakhet Gam was an adherent of the Duphas,
and is by all account one of the worst-disposed Singpho chiefs.&nbsp;
He is said even at this period still to traffic occasionally in slaves.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Kidding</i>.&mdash;A temporary village, containing about
10 houses, inhabited by Nagas, now naturalised to the plains.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>Namroop</i> <i>Puthar</i>.&mdash;So called from a plain
on the left bank of the Namroop.&nbsp; The village, which is a mean
and despicable one, is on the opposite bank.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>Beesa</i> <i>Lacoom</i>.&mdash;Is situated on the right
bank of the Darap Panee, which is fordable at the heads of the rapids.&nbsp;
It contains 12 small houses.&nbsp; The Gam is, I believe, an uncle of
the Beesa Gam, and exercises exclusive control over the tribe of Beesa
Nagas.&nbsp; This influence he appeared to exercise to our disadvantage.&nbsp;
He is a discontented man, and his behaviour to our party was very unsatisfactory.</p>
<p><i>Population</i>. <a name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116">{116}</a>
&mdash;This is scanty enough, particularly when we consider that the
houses in the above villages are much smaller than in the better sort
of Singpho villages.&nbsp; With the exception of the Kamptee village
the average number of people to each house cannot exceed five.&nbsp;
Another small Singpho village exists on the Namroop, about 3 miles from
Namroop Puthar, and not far from the site of the coal mine.</p>
<p><i>Capabilities</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Country</i>.&mdash;These
are of the usual description.&nbsp; The soil is productive enough, but
the labour of clearing the drier spots is excessive.&nbsp; Excellent
rice grounds exist in abundance between Beesa Lacoom and Namroop Puthar,
but the cultivation of this, as well as of all the other necessaries,
is limited to the quantity absolutely required.&nbsp; Scarcities of
grain are of frequent, indeed almost of annual, occurrence; and this
is chiefly owing to the pernicious influence of opium or Kanee, to which
all our Singphos are immoderately attached.&nbsp; Of the <i>Mineral</i>
<i>Productions</i>, coal and petroleum were the only ones we met with.</p>
<p><i>The</i> <i>coal</i> <i>occupies</i> the greater portion of a precipitous
part of the sandstone composing the left bank of the river Namroop.&nbsp;
Three large veins have been completely exposed by the cutting away of
the bank.&nbsp; The coal is I believe of good quality.&nbsp; The river
immediately under the veins is very deep, and were it not for the rapids
which intervene between the site of the mineral and the Booree Dihing,
it would be difficult to conceive a spot affording similar facilities
for the transmission of the mineral.&nbsp; I must however, observe,
that even in the dry season the river is navigable for small canoes
as far as the site alluded to.&nbsp; During the rains no difficulty
whatever would be experienced in the carriage, as rafts might be made
on the spot.&nbsp; No use is made of the coal by the natives, nor did
they seem to be aware of its nature.</p>
<p>Of <i>the</i> <i>Petroleum</i> <a name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117">{117}</a>
no use whatever is made, although we have ample experience from its
universal use by the Burmese, that it is a valuable product both as
affording light, and preserving in a very great degree all wooden structures
from rot and insects.&nbsp; The springs occur in four different places,
all close to the Puthar: of these three occur on the low hill which
bounds the Puthar to the southern side, and one on the Puthar itself,
at the foot of the range alluded to.&nbsp; The springs are either solitary,
as in that of the Puthar, or grouped, a number together; the discharge
varies extremely from a thin greenish aqueous fluid to a bluish grey
opaque one, of rather a thick consistence: the quantity poured out by
these latter springs is very considerable.&nbsp; On the surface of all,
but especially on these last, an oleaginous, highly inflammable fluid
collects in the form of a thin film.&nbsp; The jungle surrounding the
springs ceases abruptly, the ground around, and among them, being covered
with stunted grass and a few small herbaceous plants.&nbsp; Elephants
and large deer are frequent visitors to the springs; of the former,
the tracts are frequent, and they are sometimes shot here by the natives.</p>
<p><i>Vegetable</i> <i>Products</i>.&mdash;The jungles afford several
kinds of bamboo, some of which are of value; generally speaking the
trees are not large, with the exception of a gigantic Dipterocarpus,
wood-oil or dammar tree; of this particular tree I have seen specimens
measuring 100 feet from the base to the first branch.&nbsp; The wood
is of no value, nor have I seen any use made in Assam of the resinous
secretion, which is in great vogue on the Tenasserim Coast for the construction
of torches, etc.</p>
<h4>II.&nbsp; FROM BEESA LACOOM TO NAMTUSSEEK.</h4>
<p>COUNTRY TRAVERSED FORMING PARTS OF THE NAGA RANGE OF HILLS, AND OF
THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE VALLEY OF ASSAM: THE NORTHERN SIDE IS SUBJECT
TO BRITISH, THE SOUTHERN TO BURMESE CONTROL.</p>
<p>1st. STAGE.&mdash;<i>Halting</i> <i>place</i> in the jungle, at an
elevation of 770 feet above the sea.&nbsp; Direction SSE.&nbsp; Distance
12 miles, course over low hills covered with dense jungle.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; <i>Darap</i> <i>Panee</i>.&mdash;Altitude 1029 feet.&nbsp;
Direction SSE.&nbsp; Distance 12 miles, passed over some difficult places;
crossed the Darap twice before we reached the halting place, course
through very heavy jungle, except on the summits of the higher hills,
which are tolerably open.</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; <i>Namtusseek</i>, <a name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118">{118}</a>
or Tusseek Panee, altitude 1413 feet.&nbsp; Direction SSE.&nbsp; Distance
12 miles, country more open: summit of the hills covered with grass
and scattered trees.&nbsp; The highest hill surmounted was certainly
1000 feet above our halting place.</p>
<p>4th.&nbsp; Namtusseek, or Tusseek Panee, altitude (not observed).&nbsp;
Direction SSE.&nbsp; Distance 10 miles, course almost entirely up the
bed of the river over boulders, occasionally skirting the stream through
heavy and wet jungle.</p>
<p>5th.&nbsp; <i>Yoomsan</i> <i>nullah</i>, near the foot of the Patkaye.&nbsp;
Alt. 3026 feet; direction SSE.&nbsp; Distance 4 miles.&nbsp; Course
for a short time along the bed of the Namtusseek, until we crossed a
small stream, the Tukkakha: then ascended a mountain, about 3500 feet
high; on reaching the summit we descended until we reached the halting
place.</p>
<p>6th.&nbsp; <i>Nam</i>-<i>maroan</i>, or Maroan-kha. <a name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a">{119a}</a>
Alt. 2500 feet.&nbsp; Direction ESE.&nbsp; Distance 15 miles.&nbsp;
Ascended until we reached the summit of the Patkaye; the ascent was
in some places very steep, and owing to the unsettled state of the weather,
very difficult.&nbsp; Reached the boundary nullah, along which we proceeded
for some time; we then commenced the descent, which was steep, and continued
so, until we reached the Nam-maroan.&nbsp; The extreme elevation we
reached was rather more than 5000 feet. <a name="citation119b"></a><a href="#footnote119b">{119b}</a></p>
<p>7th.&nbsp; <i>Nam</i>-<i>maroan</i>.&mdash;Altitude estimated 2000
feet.&nbsp; Direction ESE.&nbsp; Distance 10 miles, course along the
bed of the stream; ground difficult, and much impeded by boulders.</p>
<p>8th.&nbsp; <i>Nam</i>-<i>maroan</i>.&mdash;Altitude not taken.&nbsp;
Direction ESE.&nbsp; Distance 7 miles.&nbsp; Course the same, but of
a less difficult nature.</p>
<p>9th.&nbsp; <i>Khathung</i> <i>khioung</i>. <a name="citation119c"></a><a href="#footnote119c">{119c}</a>&mdash;Altitude
1622 feet.&nbsp; Direction E. by S.&nbsp; Distance 7 miles, course continues
along the Nam-maroan, the whole way: ground much less difficult.&nbsp;
Passed close to a Singpho village of two houses; some Puthars which
bore traces of having once been cultivated and inhabited occurred on
this march.</p>
<p>10th.&nbsp; <i>Khussee</i>-<i>khioung</i>.&mdash;Altitude 3516.&nbsp;
Direction E. by S.&nbsp; Distance 13 miles, left almost immediately
the Khathung Kioung, and commenced ascending.&nbsp; Ascent in some places
very steep and difficult, and continued until we had reached an elevation
of 5600 feet.&nbsp; The descent then commenced, and continued until
we reached the Khussee-khioung, passing along for some distance the
Natkaw-khioung.&nbsp; The descent was occasionally difficult, owing
to broken ground; tree jungle occurred almost throughout the whole distance.</p>
<p>11th.&nbsp; Kuttack Bhoom. <a name="citation119d"></a><a href="#footnote119d">{119d}</a>&mdash;Altitude
3270.&nbsp; General direction S.&nbsp; Distance 13 miles.&nbsp; Left
the Khussee-khioung, but reached it again before long.&nbsp; Continued
to descend considerably, until we reached the Nam-thuga, thence the
descent increased considerably.&nbsp; Halted on an open grassy spot,
from which an extensive view of the valley of Hookhoom is obtained.</p>
<p>12th.&nbsp; <i>Namtusseek</i>.&mdash;Altitude 1099 feet.&nbsp; General
direction ESE.&nbsp; Distance 10 miles.&nbsp; Descended from Kuttack
Bhoom, until we reached the Loonkharankha, then ascended considerably.&nbsp;
The descent then recommenced, until we reached the Namtusseek.&nbsp;
Heavy jungle occurred throughout.&nbsp; Path occasionally difficult,
becoming as we approached the base of the range very wet.&nbsp; We crossed
several small mountain streams.</p>
<p><i>General</i> <i>features</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>hills</i>.&mdash;The
prevailing formation appears to be sandstone, and connected with this
we have rounded summits, not attaining a great elevation, and a considerable
depth of soil.&nbsp; The lower ranges are throughout covered with heavy
tree jungle.&nbsp; This becomes excessively thick and wet along the
water courses, which are of frequent occurrence towards the base of
the range, both on the northern and southern sides.&nbsp; But from an
elevation of 1000 feet to that of Yoomsan, a great change for the better
takes place on the northern face, the hills being covered with clay,
and generally not very high grass jungle, among which trees are scattered.&nbsp;
This character is particularly evident along both sides of the valley
drained by the Namtusseek of the northern side.&nbsp; The Patkaye is
wooded to its summit; the jungle on the south side being much more humid
than that on the northern.&nbsp; Indeed on this face of the range, with
the exception of the Puthars on the Nam-maroan, scarcely more than two
open spots exist, and both of these are of small extent.&nbsp; Of these
one exists at an elevation of 5500 feet, and one at Kuttack Bhoom.</p>
<p>The paths although very often steep, are easy enough for coolies,
except during wet weather, when they become very slippery.&nbsp; With
some degree of preparation the worst places might be made passable for
lightly loaded elephants, and this would be facilitated by the soft
nature of most of the rocks.&nbsp; The most difficult marches are those
which lie along the beds of the streams, and these, it has been seen,
are far the most numerous; they are particularly difficult for elephants,
the boulders affording a very precarious footing to these weighty animals.&nbsp;
The difficulty is much increased by rain, when even coolies find considerable
difficulty in making any progress.&nbsp; Several elephants accompanied
Major White as far as the Darap Panee, and a small suwaree elephant,
loaded with a light tent, succeeded in reaching Yoomsan.&nbsp; The southern
side of the range is decidedly of a more difficult nature than the northern,
and it is in addition of greater extent: the highest point traversed
is 5600 feet above the level of the sea.&nbsp; The range might be traversed
by a lightly loaded active native in six days.</p>
<p><i>Streams</i>.&mdash;These all partake of the usual nature of mountain
torrents; they are all fordable during the cold weather, the principal
ones being crossed at the heads of the rapids.&nbsp; The boundary nullah
is a mere streamlet: it runs between two ridges of the Patkaye: its
course being about ESE. and WNW.&nbsp; Owing to the frequency of the
streams and their mountainous nature, I should imagine that this route
is impracticable during the rains.</p>
<p><i>Villages</i>.&mdash;Not a single village or house exists directly
on the route.&nbsp; One small Naga village is visible from the Namtusseek
below Yoomsan, and a detached hut is visible here and there on a high
mountain close to, and NE. of Yoomsan.&nbsp; On the Burmese side there
is, as I have mentioned before, a village consisting of two houses close
to the route.&nbsp; This village has lately been established by some
Singphos from Nimbrung, several marches to the eastward.</p>
<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;I certainly did not see 100 Nagas throughout
the time passed in traversing these hills, although I am satisfied that
every man within a reasonable distance came into Camp in the hopes of
sharing in the extensive distribution of presents.&nbsp; From the appearance
of the country about Yoomsan, and the valley of the Namtusseek, I am
inclined to think that the population was at one time considerable.&nbsp;
The openness of the country, which is as I have previously said chiefly
clothed with grass, and the peculiar and generally imperfect aspect
of the trees, can only be accounted for, by supposing the country to
have been extensively cleared, particularly when it is remembered that
the highest portions of the range are thickly wooded.&nbsp; But allowing
this supposition to be correct, it is no proof, that the total population
has been on the decline, for we must take into account, the wandering
nature of all hill tribes.&nbsp; In forming an opinion of a hill population,
which in all times and places has, in this country at least, been found
scanty, we must take care not to confound the temporary huts, erected
in khets, for the purpose of protecting the cultivation, with actually
inhabited houses; to the former description I think the detached houses
mentioned as being visible from Yoomsan are to be referred.</p>
<p>The Nagas, at least the men, for I saw no women, are a small, active,
large-legged race, with Tartar faces.&nbsp; They are divided into very
many tribes, each of which has some peculiarity of costume.&nbsp; Those
I saw were decidedly inferior to any of the other hill tribes with which
I am acquainted.&nbsp; Their clothing is miserable, the chief protection
consisting of a number of rings, made of rattan, which encircle the
abdomen.&nbsp; They are as usual excessively dirty, and much attached
to the use of tobacco and ardent spirits.&nbsp; Their wants are few,
but even these are miserably supplied.&nbsp; They entertain an unbounded
fear of the Singphos, who appear to make any use of them they think
proper.&nbsp; Their only weapons are spears, Singpho dhas and battle
axes.</p>
<p>The Singphos cannot be considered otherwise than as encroachers.&nbsp;
Invasions of these restless marauders appear not to have been uncommon
up to a late date.&nbsp; The remains of two stockades, in which they
had entrenched themselves were extant, one close to Yoomsan, the other
on the S. face of the Patkaye.&nbsp; I have before said that the puthars
on the Nam-maroan bore evidence of having been inhabited, and apparently
to some extent.&nbsp; But even during the stay of Major White on these
hills, an irruption of Singphos from Nimbrung had taken place, and had
totally unsettled the peace of the native inhabitants.&nbsp; Such things
must be expected to occur, particularly when it is well known that the
Burmese, the only power to which they are subjects, can exercise no
authority over the Singphos in any one direction, except when they have
a large armed force in the valley of Hookhoom.</p>
<p><i>Of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Capabilities</i> of the country it would
be vain to attempt giving an opinion.&nbsp; Scarcely any cultivation
was passed on the route.&nbsp; The soil is generally deep, more or less
yellow, and somewhat clayey; the hollows having a thin superstratum
of black mould.&nbsp; Taking the deserted state of the country into
account, this part of the Naga range is of little importance, except
as forming portion of a most natural and well defined boundary, compared
with other portions of the same range to the westward.</p>
<p><i>Products</i>.&mdash;The principal mineral product is salt, an
article which is procured abundantly in some other more available points
of the range.&nbsp; We saw one small spring on the Namtusseek, from
which supplies had been lately taken.</p>
<p><i>Vegetable</i> <i>Products</i>.&mdash;Fine timber trees occur here
and there.&nbsp; Oaks, Magnolias and Chesnuts occur not uncommonly,
the Magnolias being of these in this range the most characteristic of
elevation.&nbsp; The horse chesnut of Assam, (Osculus Asamicus mihi)
occurs on both sides of the range, but does not ascend further than
3,000 feet.&nbsp; No Fir trees exist on the route, nor is it probable
that they exist on the range in this direction.&nbsp; One of the most
interesting plants is a new species of tea, which I believe to be a
genuine Thea; it is called Bun Fullup, or jungle tea, by the Assamese,
in contra-distinction to the true tea plant, which is called Fullup.&nbsp;
This species makes its appearance at an elevation of about 1,000 feet,
and is met with as high up as 4,000 feet.&nbsp; It attains the size
of a tree of 30 feet in height; it is used only as a medicine.&nbsp;
No real tea exists on this route; several plants were pointed out to
me as tea, but all were spurious instances.&nbsp; The higher portions
of the ranges have a flora approaching in many instances to that of
northern latitudes.&nbsp; As examples of this, it will be sufficient
to allude, in addition to the trees mentioned above, to the existence
of two species of Daphne, one of Barberry, several species of a genus
nearly allied to the Whortle Berries, a Violet, and several species
of Smilacine&aelig;, to which order the Lily of the Valley belongs.</p>
<p>In concluding this part of my report, I may perhaps be permitted
to advert to the question of the possibility of transporting a body
of armed men into the Burmese dominions by this route.&nbsp; Although
there is nothing in the nature of this portion of the boundary which
would render this operation very difficult, yet considering the state
of the adjoining parts of Upper Assam, and that of Hookhoom, it becomes
almost impracticable.&nbsp; I allude to the extreme difficulty of procuring
grain in Upper Assam, in which, at least around Sadiya, annual scarcities
are by no means uncommon, and to the utter impossibility of drawing
any supplies from Hookhoom in its present miserable state.&nbsp; All
the necessary supplies would require to be drawn from Lower Assam, and
for the transport of these the scanty population of this extremity of
the valley would by no means be sufficient.&nbsp; Bearing on this point
it must be remembered, that from the 1st of April to the 1st November,
these hills cannot be traversed except by their native inhabitants,
without incurring great risk from the usual severe form of jungle fever.</p>
<h4>III.&nbsp; FROM NAMTUSSEEK TO WULLABOOM.</h4>
<p>COUNTRY TRAVERSED SUBJECT TO BURMESE AUTHORITY, FORMING GREATER PORTION
OF THE VALLEY OF HOOKHOONG, OR THE PAEENDWENG.</p>
<p>March 1.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <i>Namtusseek</i> <i>to</i> <i>Nhempean</i>.&mdash;Direction
E.&nbsp; Distance 18 miles, crossed the Namtusseek, then passed through
heavy tree jungle, and subsequently over extensive grassy plains.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <i>Nhempean</i> <i>to</i> <i>Nidding</i>.&mdash;Direction
SSE.&nbsp; Distance 4&frac12; miles, course along the Namtoroan, thence
up the Saxsaikha.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <i>Nidding</i> <i>to</i> <i>Kulleyang</i>.&mdash;Direction
SSE.&nbsp; Distance 13 miles, country covered either with tree or high
grass jungle.&nbsp; Passed a deserted village, Thilling Khet.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <i>Kulleyang</i> <i>to</i> <i>Isilone</i>.&mdash;Direction
SW.&nbsp; Distance 10 miles, country rather more open.&nbsp; Puthars
are of common occurrence; passed a small village, Damoon.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <i>Tsilone</i> <i>to</i> <i>Meinkhoong</i>.&mdash;Distance
17 miles, course at first along the Namtunai, <a name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a">{124a}</a>
country open, consisting of grassy plains; several nullahs occur.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <i>Meinkhoon</i> <i>to</i> <i>Wullabhoom</i>.&mdash;Direction
SE.&nbsp; Distance 13 miles.&nbsp; Course over plains intersected by
tree jungle, subsequently up the bed of the Nempyo-kha.</p>
<p><i>Nature</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Country</i>.&mdash;The valley
of Hookhoong, or as the Burmese call it, in allusion to its amber mines,
Paeendweng, is of small extent.&nbsp; Its greatest diameter is in the
direction of E. to W., <a name="citation124b"></a><a href="#footnote124b">{124b}</a>
its southern termination being within a few miles from Wullabhoom.&nbsp;
It is surrounded on all sides by hills, the highest of which are towards
the NE. and E.; none however would appear to exceed 6000 feet in height;
and from their appearance, I imagine they are wooded to their summits.&nbsp;
The lowest hills are those which form the southern boundary, and these
scarcely deserve the name.&nbsp; From Kuttack-bhoom a fine view of the
valley is obtained; it is here very narrow, and does not I should think
exceed 25 miles in breadth.&nbsp; The features of the country are in
a striking degree similar to those of Upper Assam, that is, it presents
a plain surface intersected frequently by belts of jungle, the parts
at the base of the boundary hills being exclusively occupied by heavy
jungle.&nbsp; The general elevation of the plain above the sea may be
estimated at about 1000 feet, so that it is several hundred feet above
the level of Sadiya.&nbsp; But although this is the case, the valley
of Hookhoom undergoes the same changes during the rainy season as Assam,
the greater part being during that period under water.</p>
<p><i>Of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Climate</i> it is perhaps presumptuous to
give any opinion; it is however by no means so cold as that of Upper
Assam.&nbsp; In April the daily range of the thermometer was very considerable,
from 60&deg; to 88&deg;.&nbsp; The rains set in later than on the northern
side of the Patkaye, and they are said to be much less severe.</p>
<p><i>The</i> <i>rivers</i> are numerous, the principal one is the Namtunai,
<a name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125">{125}</a> which subsequently
assumes the name of Kyeendweng.&nbsp; This is in the places I saw it
a large, generally deep and sluggish stream, varying in breadth from
270 to 350 yards.&nbsp; The next in size is the Namtoroan, which has
more of the character of a mountain stream; it is of considerable breadth
(opposite Nhempean it is 270 yards across,) and presents numerous rapids.&nbsp;
Both of these rivers are navigable for boats of some size.&nbsp; The
other rivers are small and insignificant; all fall into the Namtoroan
or Namtunai.</p>
<p><i>Villages</i>.&mdash;Of these the following were passed on the
route:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>Nhempean</i>, on the right bank of the Namtoroan, is
situated on an extensive open grassy plain, it is stockaded: it contains
about 12 houses, the river is here navigable for middling sized canoes.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Tubone</i>, on the same bank, but lower down, and within
quarter of a mile of Nhempean, it is of about the same size, and similarly
stockaded.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Nidding</i>, on the left bank of the Saxsai-kha, about
three-quarters of a mile above its junction with the Namtoroan: it is
a stockaded village, and about the same size.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>Calleyang</i>, on the Prong-kha contains about 8 houses:
it is not stockaded.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>Lamoon</i>, on the Moneekha, is a very small village,
containing four or five houses: it is not stockaded.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>Tsilone</i>, on the left bank of the Namtunai.&nbsp;
This is the Dupha Gam&rsquo;s village: it is of the ordinary size, and
is stockaded in the usual manner.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <i>Meinkhoon</i>, on the Cadeekha, by which it is intersected;
it consists of two stockades, separated by the above stream; and contains
about 25 houses, none of which are however large.&nbsp; It is here that
the first Pagodas (Poongye houses) occur.&nbsp; The village is situated
on an open grassy plain of considerable extent.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; <i>Wullabhoom</i>, on the right bank of the Nemokapy, an
insignificant stream.&nbsp; This village is not stockaded; it contains
about 10 houses, of which several are of the Singpho structure.</p>
<p>The Gam of this village was in expectation of an attack from the
Dupha people, and had in consequence erected a small square stockade
for his own use; he had however built it so small that he might easily
be dislodged by means of a long spear.</p>
<p>In addition to these, there is a village called <i>Bone</i>, on the
Namtoroan; the path leading to this is crossed soon after leaving Namtusseek,
and another stockaded village, on the right bank of the Namtoroan, a
little below the mouth of the Saxsai-kha.</p>
<p>None of the above villages are situated on strong positions.&nbsp;
The stockades are as usual of bamboo, and are but weak defences; the
space between the stockade and the outer palisades is covered with short
pointed bamboos, placed obliquely in the ground: these are called Panjahs
by the Assamese; they inflict very troublesome wounds, and are universally
employed by the Singphos.&nbsp; The interiors of the stockades are dirty,
the houses are built without order, and generally fill the stockade
completely, so that the people inside might be burnt out with the greatest
ease.&nbsp; The average number of houses in each of the above villages,
may be estimated at about 12, of these the largest occur at Wullaboom.&nbsp;
They are built on muchowns, and resemble in all respects those of our
Assam Singphos.&nbsp; They are generally thatched with grass (Imperata
cylindrica. <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126">{126}</a>
) The larger kinds have invariably one end unenclosed; under this portico,
which is usually of some size, all the domestic operations are carried
on.&nbsp; The Dupha Gam&rsquo;s is not distinguished above the rest
in any one way.</p>
<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;No country inhabited by sets of petty chieftains
belonging to different tribes, which are generally at enmity with each
other, can be populous; it is therefore with considerable surprise that
I find it stated that the number of houses in the north and eastern
sides of the valley is estimated at not less than 3000, which at the
rate of 7 men to one house, which is, considering the great size of
very many Singpho houses, rather underrated, would make the population
of these portions of the valley amount to 21,000 souls.&nbsp; The part
of the valley which I have traversed, and during which route 75 miles
of ground were passed over, does not present a single sign which, in
the absence of direct evidence, would lead one to suppose that it contained
a considerable population.&nbsp; During the before mentioned marches,
I saw only four paths, crossing or diverging from that which we followed.&nbsp;
Of these, one <i>leads</i>, as I have mentioned, to Bone, one to the
hills on the NE., one to a Singpho village, some miles to the south
of our track, and the fourth diverged from the path leading to the Amber
mines through the village of a chief called Tharapown Hhoung.&nbsp;
The population on the above route of 75 miles, would at the rate of
7 men to one house, and 12 houses to each village, amount only to 840,
but I think that 1,100 or 1,200 would be a fairer estimate.&nbsp; From
Kuttack-bhoom, as I have mentioned, a great portion of the valley is
distinctly seen, and nothing meets the eye but jungle, broken here and
there by the waters of the Namtunai: not a clearing is even visible;
instead of a population of 30,000, as has been stated I should imagine
that the whole valley of Hookhoom does not contain more than 12,000.</p>
<p>The above population consists almost entirely of Singphos and their
Assamese slaves, and these last form a considerable portion.&nbsp; This
was particularly evident at Wulla-khoon, where they certainly out-numbered
their masters.</p>
<p>The Singphos of Hookhoong resemble exactly those located in Assam:
they are however less given to opium eating.&nbsp; They are of the same
indolent habits, and content themselves with cultivating sufficient
grain to keep themselves from starving.&nbsp; The women wear the Thumein,
or Burmese dress, a costume which is entirely unknown among the Singphos
of Assam.&nbsp; The most superior men I saw belonged to the Lupai tribe,
from the east of the Irrawaddi; they had come to Meinkhoon for the purpose
of procuring amber.&nbsp; In manners and dress they resembled the Shan-Chinese,
they were provided with firelocks, in the use of which they were certainly
adroit.&nbsp; The usual weapons of the Hookhoong Singphos are dhas and
spears.&nbsp; I saw very few muskets.</p>
<p>The behaviour of these people was throughout civil, and perhaps friendly.&nbsp;
Their hatred of the Burmese is excessive, the visits of the armed forces
of this nation being most harassing and oppressive.&nbsp; They are sub-divided
into tribes, among whom there is but little unanimity.&nbsp; The Dupha
Gam is much disliked, as he is considered the cause of the visit of
the Burmese.&nbsp; His power has been much exaggerated; he is not capable
of bringing 500 men into the field.&nbsp; So unpopular was he, that
it was reported to Mr. Bayfield, that he was to be cut off immediately
the Burmese force had left the valley.</p>
<p>In giving the foregoing low estimate of the population of the valley,
I believe I have taken into consideration every circumstance of importance.&nbsp;
The occurrence of several old burial places on the route, some of which
are of considerable extent, might be considered by some as a proof,
that the population has undergone a decrease; but I conceive that it
is sufficiently accounted for by the wandering habits of the people.</p>
<p><i>Capabilities</i>.&mdash;The greater part of the valley is well
adapted for the cultivation of rice, and as the soil is generally rich,
approaching in external characters to that of some parts of Upper Assam,
particularly Muttack, it is capable of supporting a large population.</p>
<p><i>Products</i>.&mdash;Of the mineral productions, the most remarkable
is Amber, for which the valley of Hookhoong has been long famous, and
from the existence of which it derives its Burmese name.&nbsp; The mines
are situated in low, wooded hills, from which they are distant between
five and six miles; of this distance the first three miles traverse
the plain on which Meinkhoong is situated.&nbsp; The pits now worked
give occupation to about a dozen people; they occur on the brow of a
hill: they are square, and of various depth, the deepest being about
40 feet, the diameter not exceeding three feet; the workmen ascending
and descending by placing their feet in holes made in two faces of the
square.&nbsp; No props are used to prevent the sides of the pits from
falling in, the tenacity of the soil rendering this precaution unnecessary.&nbsp;
The instruments used, are small wooden shovels, a wooden crow-bar tipped
with iron for displacing the soil or breaking the rocks, baskets for
removing the substances so displaced, buckets made of the bark of trees
<a name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128">{128}</a> for removing
the water which is met with in the deepest pits, and rude levers similar
to those used in Madras for the purposes of irrigation, for carrying
the soil, etc. from the pits to the surface; these however are only
used in the deeper pits, a hooked bamboo answering the purpose in the
shallower ones.</p>
<p>The soil throughout the upper portion, and indeed for a depth of
from 15 to 20 feet, is clayey and red: the remainder consists of a greyish-black
carbonaceous earth, increasing in density with the depth, and being
very hard at a depth of 40 feet.&nbsp; The amber occurs in both these,
the clue to its existence being the presence of small masses of lignite.&nbsp;
The searching occupies but very little time, as the presence of the
lignite is readily ascertained; all I saw dug out occurred as small
irregular deposits; it did not appear to be abundant.&nbsp; The people
appear to have no guide for the selections of favourable spots on which
to commence their operations; but having once met with a good pit, they
dig other pits all around, and often within a distance of two feet from
the first one sunk.</p>
<p>I could not succeed in procuring a single fine specimen; indeed the
workmen denied having found any of value during the last six years!&nbsp;
It is an article in great request among the Chinese and Singphos; at
the pits, however, it is not high priced, and a first rate pair of ear-rings
are procurable at Meinkhoong for 5 tickals; in Assam 10 rupees are occasionally
given.&nbsp; Meinkhoong is annually visited by parties of Shan-Chinese,
for the purpose of procuring this mineral; the caravan at the time I
passed this village had returned, and I believe was met by Mr. Bayfield.&nbsp;
There was a small party of Lupai Singphos from the East of the Irrawaddi,
consisting of a Tsonba and six or seven followers still waiting for
a supply.</p>
<p>The spot occupied by pits is considerable, but three-fourths of these
are no longer worked.&nbsp; Compared with the Serpentine mines, they
are but of small value.</p>
<p>Both <i>Coal</i> <i>and</i> <i>Salt</i> exist in the valley; the
only indication of the existence of the former I saw, was a mass of
lignite in the bed of a nullah between Tsilone and Meinkhoong.</p>
<p><i>Vegetable</i> <i>products</i>.&mdash;Fine timber trees, <a name="citation129"></a><a href="#footnote129">{129}</a>
which belong to the same genus as the Saul, occur between Nhempean and
Namtusseek, and elsewhere towards the foot of the hills surrounding
the valley.</p>
<p>The Mulberry of Upper Assam occurs likewise, and the leaves supply
with food a species of silkworm.&nbsp; From the silk a coarse species
of cloth is manufactured, but the use of this appears to be very limited.</p>
<p>Tea appears to be of uncommon occurrence.&nbsp; The only specimens
I saw were given me by Mr. Bayfield, they were procured from low hills
some distance from Shellingket.&nbsp; On this subject Mr. Bayfield made
very frequent and minute enquiries, and the result appears to be that
the plant is of rare occurrence; none exists towards or about the amber
mines.</p>
<p>The Room of Upper Assam (Ruellia Indigofera Mihi) is in use for dyeing
cloths, but not so much so as in Assam.</p>
<p>The cultivated plants are of the ordinary kind; and the produce is
just sufficient to meet the wants of the inhabitants.&nbsp; Owing to
the presence of the Myoowoon&rsquo;s force, rice was scarce during my
visit; the price was seven tickals a basket, each of which contains
about 30 days&rsquo; supply for one man.</p>
<p>The domestic animals are of the ordinary description: fowls forming
the only poultry.&nbsp; But on this subject it is unnecessary to enlarge,
as the habits and manners of the people are precisely the same as those
of the Assamese Singphos.</p>
<h4>IV.&nbsp; FROM WULLABHOOM TO MOGOUNG.</h4>
<p>COUNTRY TRAVERSED FORMING CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE MOGOUNG VALLEY,
THROUGHOUT SUBJECT TO BURMESE AUTHORITY.</p>
<p>March 1.&nbsp; <i>Halted</i> on a small stream, a tributary of the
Mogoung river.&mdash;Direction nearly S. distance 22 miles, course at
first along the Namphyet, thence over low hills, forming part of the
S. boundary of the valley of Hookhoong.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Halted</i> on the Mogoung river.&mdash;Direction S. distance
22 miles, over similar low hills until we reached the Mogoung river
after a march of four hours, soon descending into its bed, which we
followed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Mogoung</i> river.&mdash;Direction S. distance 13 miles,
course along the bed of the river.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>Mogoung</i> river.&mdash;-Direction SE. distance 14 miles,
course continued along the bed of the river.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>Kamein</i>.&mdash;Direction SSE. distance 14 miles: on
starting left the Mogoung river: course throughout over fine open high
plains intersected by belts of jungle.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <i>Kamein</i> <i>to</i> <i>Mogoung</i>.&mdash;Direction
SSE.&nbsp; Distance 25 miles, course over high open plains and dry woods.&nbsp;
Many nullahs occurred on the route: crossed the Mogoung river opposite
to Kamein.</p>
<p><i>Nature</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Country</i>.&mdash;The low
hills which are passed before reaching the Mogoung river, are covered
with tree jungle, but they afford scarcely any thing of interest; they
are here and there intersected by small plains, covered with the usual
grasses. <a name="citation130"></a><a href="#footnote130">{130}</a>&nbsp;
The country traversed while following the Mogoung river, is most uninteresting,
the road following almost entirely the sandy bed of the river, the banks
of which are either covered with grass or tree jungle.&nbsp; On leaving
this most tortuous river, the face of the country improved and became
very picturesque, presenting almost exclusively fine high, and rather
extensive plains covered with grass, and partially with trees, while
here and there they are intersected by strips of dry tree jungle.&nbsp;
Low hills are visible frequently, especially to the eastward.</p>
<p><i>Villages</i> <i>and</i> <i>Towns</i>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>Kamein</i>, on the right bank of the Mogoung river, at
the junction of the Endaw-khioung, consists of two stockades, one on
a small hill the other at the foot.&nbsp; Both together contain about
32 houses.&nbsp; The inhabitants are Shans.&nbsp; It is a place of some
consequence, as it is on the route from Mogoung to the Serpentine mines.&nbsp;
From Kamein, Shewe Down Gyee, a conspicuous mountain, so called, bears
east.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Mogoung</i>, on the right bank of the river of the same
name, just below the junction to the Namyeen Khioung, contains rather
fewer than 300 houses.&nbsp; Although it contains so few houses it is
a place of considerable extent.&nbsp; It is surrounded by the remains
of a timber stockade, similar in construction to those of Burmah proper.&nbsp;
The houses are mostly small, and I speak within bounds when I say, that
there is not a single one that bears the stamp of respectability.&nbsp;
There is a bazaar, but nothing good is procurable in it.&nbsp; Tea and
sugar-candy are rare and high priced.&nbsp; Pork is plentiful.&nbsp;
Mogoung is situated in a plain of some extent, this plain is surrounded
in almost every direction by hills, all of which, with the exception
of Shewe Down Gyee, are low: the nearest of these are about three miles
off.</p>
<p>The inhabitants are mostly Shans, there are some Assamese, the chief
of whom is a relation of Chundra Kant, the ex-Rajah of Assam.&nbsp;
The best street in the town, though one of small extent, is that occupied
by the resident Chinese, none of whom however are natives of China proper.&nbsp;
Of this people I should say there are barely 60 in Mogoung, and, judging
from their houses, none of which are of brick, I should say they are
very inferior to their fellow-countrymen residing in Bamo.</p>
<p>During our stay in Mogoung, which was protracted owing to the disturbed
state of the country, the population was much increased by Shan-Chinese
returning from the Serpentine mines; and as there was a considerable
number of boats engaged by them for the transportation of the Serpentine,
the town looked busier than it otherwise would have done.</p>
<p>The Mogoung, river is here about 100 yards broad, but it is much
subdivided by sand banks: it is navigable for moderate sized boats a
considerable distance above the town.&nbsp; In the upper part of the
course this river abounds with fish to an unprecedented degree; of these
the most numerous is the Bokhar of Assam, and of this I have seen shoals
of immense extent.</p>
<p>The Namyeen is a small and shallow stream.&nbsp; Although from the
extent of the stockade Mogoung has evidently in former periods (during
the Shan dynasty) been of extent and consequence, it is at present a
mean and paltry town.&nbsp; It derives any little consequence it possesses
from being the rendezvous of the Shan-Chinese, who flock here annually
for procuring Serpentine.</p>
<p>The most valuable product of the Mogoung district is the Serpentine;
the mines producing which, we visited from Kamein.&nbsp; The marches
are as follows,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <i>Kamein</i> <i>to</i> <i>Endawkhioung</i>.&mdash;Direction
SSW.&nbsp; Distance 10 miles, course over low hills covered with jungle,
with intervening grassy valleys of small extent; crossed the Isee Een
nullah.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Halted</i> <i>on</i> <i>a</i> <i>plain</i>, on a patch
of ground lately under cultivation.&nbsp; Direction SSW.&nbsp; Distance
14 miles.&nbsp; Course over a similar tract of country; continued for
some time close to the Endawkhioung; crossed several nullahs.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Halted</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>jungle</i>.&mdash;Direction
WNW.&nbsp; Distance 17 miles.&nbsp; Country the same: we changed our
course on reaching the path which leads to Kionkseik, a Singpho village,
diverging to the N.; halted within a short distance of Kuwa Bhoom.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>Reached</i> <i>the</i> <i>mines</i>.&mdash;Direction
WNW.&nbsp; Distance 10 miles, course over small plains and through jungle
until we reached Kuwa Bhoom, which we ascended in a WNW. direction,
extreme altitude attained 2,799 feet.&nbsp; The descent was steep, varied
by one or two steep ascents of some hundred feet in height.&nbsp; On
nearing the base of the range we continued through heavy and wet jungle,
until we arrived at the mines.</p>
<p>These celebrated Serpentine <a name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132">{132}</a>
mines occupy a valley of somewhat semi-circular form, and bounded on
all sides by thickly wooded hills of no great height.&nbsp; To the north
the valley passes off into a ravine, down which a small streamlet that
drains the valley escapes, and along this, at a distance of two or three
miles, another spot of ground affording Serpentine is said to occur.&nbsp;
The valley is small: its greatest diameter, which is from E. to W. being
about three-quarters of a mile, and its smallest breadth varying from
460 to 600 or 700 yards.</p>
<p>The whole of the valley, which appears formerly to have been occupied
by rounded hillocks, presents a confused appearance, being dug up in
every direction, and in the most indiscriminate way; no steps being
taken to remove the earth, etc. that have been thrown up in various
places during the excavations.&nbsp; Nothing in fact like a pit or a
shaft exists, nor is there any thing to repay one for the tediousness
of the march from Kamein.</p>
<p>The stone is found in the form of more or less rounded boulders mixed
with other boulders of various rocks and sizes imbedded in brick-coloured
yellow or nearly orange-coloured clay, which forms the soil of the valley,
and which is of considerable depth.&nbsp; The excavations vary much
in form, some resembling trenches; none exceed 20 feet in depth.&nbsp;
The workmen have no mark by which to distinguish at sight the Serpentine
from the other boulders; to effect this, fracture is resorted to, and
this they accomplish, I believe, by means of fire.&nbsp; I did not see
the manner in which they work, or the tools they employ, all the Shans
having left for Kamein, as the season had already been over for some
days.&nbsp; No good specimens were procurable.&nbsp; The workmen reside
in the valley, drawing their supplies from Kioukseik.</p>
<p>On our road to the mines we met daily, and especially on the last
march, parties of Shan-Chinese, Burmese, and a few Singphos on their
return.&nbsp; Of these in all Mr. Bayfield counted about 1,100, of whom
about 700 were Shan-Chinese: these were accompanied by ponies, which
they ordinarily use as beasts of burden.&nbsp; The larger blocks of
stone were carried by four or five men, on bamboo frames; the smaller,
but which still are of considerable size, on ingenious frames which
rest on the nape of the coolies&rsquo; neck; the frame has two long
arms which the bearer grasps in his hand, and which enables him to relieve
himself of his burden, and re-assume it without much sacrifice of labour,
as he props his load against a tree, which is then raised by the legs
of the frame some height from the ground.&nbsp; The valley we visited
affords I believe the greatest quantity of the stone, which is said
to be annually diminishing, neither are pieces of the finest sort so
often procurable as they were formerly wont to be.</p>
<p>The path to the mines is on the whole good; it is choked up here
and there by jungle, and the occurrence of one or two marshy places
contribute to render it more difficult.&nbsp; It bears ample evidences
of being a great thoroughfare.</p>
<p>The greater part of the stone procured is removed in the large masses,
to Kioukseik, and thence by water by the aid of the Endawkhioung to
Mogoung.&nbsp; At this place duties are levied upon it.&nbsp; Hence
almost the whole is taken to Topo by water.&nbsp; From this place the
Shan-Chinese carry it to their own country on ponies.</p>
<p>From the stone various ornaments are made; from the inferior kind,
bangles, cups, etc. and from the superior, which is found in small portions
generally within the larger masses, rings, etc.&nbsp; The stone is,
I am informed by Mr. Bayfield, cut by means of twisted copper wire.&nbsp;
The price of the inferior kind is high.</p>
<p>It is from these mines that the province of Mogoung derives its importance;
so much so, that its revenue is said to exceed that of any other Burman
Province.&nbsp; The sum derived from the Serpentine alone is stated
to be occasionally as high as 40,000 Rs. per annum.</p>
<p>Owing to the avidity with which this product is sought after by the
Chinese, it is highly desirable to ascertain whether it exists in Assam,
which indeed is probably the case.&nbsp; I believe it is reported to
exist near Beesa; at any rate, blood-stone is found in this extremity
of the valley of Assam, and this, in Chinese eyes, is of considerable
value.&nbsp; If the Serpentine is found, specimens should be sent to
Mogoung.&nbsp; As the Shan-Chinese are reported to be a most penurious
race, a small reduction in the price below that of the Burmese, would
suffice to divert the current of the trade into Assam.&nbsp; Another
interesting product, although of no value, exists in the shape of an
Alkaline spring on the Sapiya Khioung, which hence derives its name.&nbsp;
The water of this spring bubbles up sparingly and quietly from under
the rocky bed of the above mountain torrent, it is quite clear, of a
decided and pure alkaline taste: it is used by the natives for the purpose
of washing, and it answers this remarkably well.&nbsp; Of this interesting
spring Mr. Bayfield took specimens for analysis.</p>
<p>Salt is procurable within a distance of three or four days from Kioukseik.</p>
<p><i>Vegetable</i> <i>products</i>.&mdash;Teak, and some of it is of
a fine description, occurs both on the route between the Mogoung river
and Kamein, as well as between Kamein and the Serpentine mines.&nbsp;
The natives do not however appear to cut it, probably owing to the want
of water carriage.&nbsp; Fine timber trees, nearly allied to the Saul,
likewise occur on the road to the mines.</p>
<p>I met with the tea but once.&nbsp; This occurred among the low hills
dividing the Mogoung district from the valley of Hookhoong, close to
the Dupai-beng-kheoung, or Tea tree Nullah.&nbsp; There was no difference
in the specimens brought to me from the plant of Assam, with the exception
that the leaves were even larger than in the plant alluded to; it did
not occur in abundance.&nbsp; It exists I believe, in another place
on this route, and among the same hills, but I did not succeed in procuring
specimens.&nbsp; Throughout both routes scarcely any cultivation was
seen.&nbsp; Between the Mogoung river and Mogoung town considerable
portions of some low hills to the East, presented the appearance of
clearings.&nbsp; It must however be observed, that the appearance of
clearings is a most fallacious ground on which to form an estimate of
the population; 1st, owing to the habits of a nomadic population; 2ndly,
because a spot once cleared, keeps up the appearance of a clearing for
a long time; and 3rdly, because some particular spots are, from some
local cause or other, exclusively inhabited by grasses, the prevalence
of which will at a little distance always give one the idea of cultivation.</p>
<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;This in the somewhat extensive tract of
the Mogoung district traversed, is very scanty.&nbsp; That of Mogoung
and suburbs may be estimated at about 1,600, and that of Kamein at 250.&nbsp;
In addition to these places, I have to mention a small Singpho village
of three or four houses, seen on a range of hills during our first march
towards the mines, and bearing about WNW., and Kioukseik.&nbsp; This
latter place we visited on our return from the mines, it is a stockaded
village, containing 16 houses, and about 120 souls.&nbsp; It is situated
about 100 yards from a small stream, the Nam Teen: it is inhabited by
Singphos: it is about a mile from the divergence of the road to the
mines, and bears from this spot nearly due south.&nbsp; During the season
of operations at the mines it is a place of some consequence, as all
the necessary supplies of grain are procured from it.&nbsp; At the time
of our visit, there was a good sized bazaar along the Nam Teen, which
was likewise a good deal crowded by boats.</p>
<p>The neighbouring hills are inhabited here and there by Kukkeens,
the most troublesome perhaps of all mountainous tribes; but there are
some other villages about the lake, called the Endawgyee.&nbsp; We had
an opportunity of viewing from a distance the above lake on our return
from the mines.&nbsp; From an open spot on the eastern face of Kuwa
Bhoom, it bore nearly due south, and was estimated as being 15 miles
distant.&nbsp; We could not distinguish its outline, but we saw enough
to satisfy us that it was a large body of water.&nbsp; It is situated
in an extensive plain near a range of hills, part of which form portion
of its banks.&nbsp; From the same spot we could see Shewe Down Gyee,
the large range from which the Namtunai takes its course, bearing nearly
due east, and at an estimated distance of 35 miles; the situation of
the mines is therefore nearly due east from Kamein.</p>
<h4>V.&nbsp; FROM MOGOUNG TO AVA.</h4>
<p>THE WHOLE OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO ABOVE PLACES WAS PERFORMED
BY WATER.</p>
<p>The time occupied in descending the Mogoung river was three days.&nbsp;
This river is exceedingly tortuous, generally a good deal subdivided,
and its channels are in many places shallow.&nbsp; The chief obstacle
it presents to navigation consists in rapids, which commence below Tapan,
and continue for some distance; these rapids are not severe, but are
rendered difficult by the presence of rocks, many of large size.&nbsp;
These rapids commence immediately the river in its course approaches
some low ranges of hills.&nbsp; Boats of considerable size however manage
to reach Mogoung; they ascend the severer rapids in channels made along
the sides of the river, by removing and piling up on either side the
boulders which form great part of the bed of the river in these places.&nbsp;
The descent is managed in the same way, the speed of the boat being
retarded by the crew exerting their united force in an opposite direction.&nbsp;
On leaving the proximity of the hills, the river resumes its natural
and rather slow character, and towards its mouth there is scarcely any
stream at all.&nbsp; The channels are much impeded by stumps of trees.&nbsp;
The country through which the Mogoung river passes is very uninteresting,
and almost exclusively jungle, either tree or high grass.</p>
<p>Only one village, Tapan, is met with; this is small, and is situated
on the right bank; with the exception of its river face it is stockaded.&nbsp;
At this place the Shan-Chinese leave the river, striking off in an E.
direction towards the Irrawaddi, which they reach in one day.&nbsp;
We observed a small Kukkeen village on some hills near Tapan; with these
exceptions no sign of inhabitants occurred until we reached the Irrawaddi.&nbsp;
On the hills above alluded to, the bitter Tea is reported to exist.&nbsp;
The Mogoung river at its mouth is about 70 yards across.&nbsp; The Irrawaddi
even at the mouth of the Mogoung river, and at a distance of nearly
800 miles from the sea, keeps up its magnificent character.&nbsp; At
this point it is 900 or 1,000 yards across; when we reached it, it had
risen considerably, and the appearance of this vast sheet of water was
really grand.&nbsp; Its characters are very different from the Ganges
and Burrumpooter, its waters being much more confined to one bed, and
comparatively speaking becoming seldom spread out.&nbsp; Generally speaking
it is deep and the stream is not violent.&nbsp; It appears to me to
afford every facility for navigation; in one or two places troublesome
shallows are met with, and in several places the channel near the banks
is impeded by rocks.&nbsp; It is only in the upper defile, or Kioukdweng,
that the navigation is during the rises of the river dangerous, and
at times impracticable.&nbsp; On our reaching Tsenbo, which is about
12 miles below the junction of the Mogoung river with the Irrawaddi,
the river continued to rise in a most rapid degree, Mr. Bayfield ascertaining
by measurement that it rose 16 inches an hour.&nbsp; We were consequently
compelled to push on, as we were informed that the next day the defile
would be impassable.&nbsp; The Kioukdweng alluded to commences about
two miles below Tsenbo, the river becoming constricted from 1000 to
150 yards.&nbsp; The rush of water was great, and was rendered fierce
by rocks which exist in the midst of the river.&nbsp; Still further
within the defile the difficulties were increased; at one place the
whole of the enormous body of water rushes through a passage, and it
is the only one, certainly not exceeding 50 yards in width.&nbsp; The
passage of this was really fearful, for on clearing it we were encountered
by strong eddies, backwaters and whirlpools, which rendered the boat
nearly unmanageable.&nbsp; These scenes continued, varied every now
and then by an expanded and consequently more tranquil stream, until
a gorge is passed, well known by the name of the &ldquo;Elephant and
Cow,&rdquo; two rocks which are fancifully supposed to resemble the
above named animals; the defile then becomes much wider, and the waters
flow in a tranquil and rather sluggish manner.&nbsp; The depth of the
river in this defile is, as may be supposed, immense; Mr. Bayfield ascertained
during his passage up, at a season when the waters were low, that in
many places no bottom was to be found at a depth of 45 fathoms.&nbsp;
The necessity of this enormous depth is at once evident, and is pointed
out by the configuration of the banks, which are in many places sheer
precipices.&nbsp; Two other defiles exist between Bamo and Ava, of these
the middle or second is the shortest, in both the stream flows sluggishly,
and there is no impediment whatever to navigation.&nbsp; In these the
depth is great, but owing to their greater width, much less so than
in the upper.</p>
<p>The temperature of the waters of the Irrawaddi is as usually obtains,
except during the rises of the river caused by the melting of snow,
when it is higher than usual.</p>
<p><i>Tributaries</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Irrawaddi</i> <i>between</i>
<i>Mogoung</i> <i>river</i> <i>and</i> <i>Ava</i>.</p>
<p>The number of tributaries even to Rangoon is unprecedentedly small:
this tends to increase the astonishment with which one regards this
magnificent river.</p>
<p>The rivers that fall into the Irrawaddi within the above distance
are,</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; The Mogoung river.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; Tapien Khioung, above Bamo.</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; Shewe Lee Khioung.</p>
<p>These are about the same size, and only discharge a considerable
quantity of water during the rainy season.&nbsp; The Shewe Lee at its
mouth, is between 5 and 600 yards wide, but only an inconsiderable portion
of this is occupied by water, and this to no depth.</p>
<p>The great branch from which the Irrawaddi derives its vast supply
of water still remains to be discovered, and will probably be found
to be the Shoomaee Kha.&nbsp; It is evident, at any rate, that the great
body of water comes from the eastward, for between the Mogoung river
and Borkhamtee, in which country Captain Wilcox visited the Irrawaddi,
and where it was found to be of no great size, no considerable branch
finds its way from the Westward: neither are the hills which intervene
between these points, of such height as to afford large supplies of
water.</p>
<p>On the whole it is, I think, probable, that the Irrawaddi is an outlet
for some great river, which drains an extensive tract of country; for
it appears to me that if all its waters are poured in by mountain streams,
a tract of country extensive beyond all analogy, will be required for
the supply of such a vast body of water.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three rivers, few nullahs exist, but these
are scarcely worthy of consideration.</p>
<p><i>Nature</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>country</i>.&mdash;From the
mouth of the Mogoung river nearly to Tsenbo the country is flat, and
the banks wooded or covered with grass to the brink.&nbsp; The range
of hills which form the upper Kioukdweng there commence, and continue
for a distance of 16 or 20 miles, during the whole of which they form
the banks of the river.&nbsp; These hills are scantily covered with
trees, most of which are in addition stunted.&nbsp; The vegetation within
the maximum high water mark consists of a few scraggy shrubs.&nbsp;
The rocks composing these hills are principally serpentine, which within
the influence of the water is of a dark sombre brown colour.&nbsp; Limestone
occurs occasionally.</p>
<p>From this Kioukdweng to the second, the entrance of which (coming
from above) is at Tsenkan, the features of the country are of the ordinary
alluvial description, and the river is a good deal spread out and subdivided
by islands, covered with moderate sized grasses.&nbsp; On leaving the
second Kioukdweng the same scenery occurs, the banks are generally tolerably
high, often gravelly or clayey.&nbsp; About Tsagaiya, a few miles below
the mouth of the Shewe Lee, low hills approach the river, and they continue
along one or both banks <a name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139">{139}</a>
at variable distance until one reaches Ava.&nbsp; These hills are all
covered with a partial and stunted vegetation, chiefly of thorny shrubs,
and present uniformly a rugged raviny and barren appearance.&nbsp; The
scenery of the river is in many places highly picturesque, and in the
upper Kioukdweng and portion of the second, where there is a remarkable
cliff of about 3,000 feet in height, bold and even grand.</p>
<p><i>Villages</i> <i>and</i> <i>Towns</i>.&mdash;These although numerous
compared with the almost deserted tracts hitherto passed, are by no
means so much so as to give an idea of even a moderate population.&nbsp;
From the mouth of the Mogoung river to the Kioukdweng there are several
villages, but all are small, mean, and insignificant.&nbsp; Strange
to say, they are defenceless, although the neighbouring Kukkeens are
dangerous and cruel neighbours.&nbsp; Nothing can be more calculated
to shew the weakness of the Burmese government than the fact, that the
most mischievous and frequent aggressions of these hill tribes always
go unpunished, although a short time after an attack the very band by
whom it has been made will enter even large towns to make purchases,
perhaps with money the produce of their robberies.</p>
<p>The upper Kioukdweng has a very scanty population, consisting of
a distinct race of people called Phoons: who are sub-divided into two
tribes, the greater and lesser Phoons.&nbsp; About 12 villages occur
in this defile, and Mr. Bayfield says that the population is almost
entirely confined to the banks of the river: all these villages are
small.</p>
<p>Between the defile and Bamo a good number of villages occur, the
largest of which does not contain more than 100 houses, the generality
are small and mean.&nbsp; Bamo, which is a place of celebrity, and is
perhaps the third town in Burmah, is situated on the left bank of the
river, which is here, including the two islands which subdivide it into
three channels, about a mile and a quarter in width; the channel on
which Bamo is situated is the principal one.&nbsp; The town occupies
rather a high bank of yellow clay, along which it extends for rather
more than a mile, its extreme breadth being perhaps 350 yards.&nbsp;
It is surrounded by a timber stockade, the outer palisades being well
pangoed; the defences had just undergone repair owing to an expected
attack from the Kukkeens.&nbsp; It contains within the stockade rather
less than 600 houses, (the precise number was ascertained personally
by Mr. Bayfield,) and including the suburbs, which consist of two small
villages at the northern end, one at the southern, and one occupied
by Assamese at the eastern, it contains about 750 houses.&nbsp; These
are generally of the usual poor and mean description; indeed, not even
excepting the Governor&rsquo;s house, there is not a good Burman or
Shan house in the place.&nbsp; One street which occupies a portion of
the river bank, is inhabited by Chinese, and contains about 100 houses;
these are built of unburnt brick, and have a peculiar blueish appearance;
none are of any size.&nbsp; The best building in Bamo is the Chinese
place of worship.&nbsp; Those occupied by the Burmese have the usual
form.&nbsp; The country adjoining Bamo is flat, dry, and I should think
unproductive; it is intersected by low swampy ravines, one or two of
which extend into the town.&nbsp; To the south there is an extensive
marsh, partially used for rice-cultivation.</p>
<p>The population of Bamo including the suburbs, may be estimated at
about 4500, of whom 4 or 500 are Chinese.&nbsp; The governor is a bigoted
Burman, of disagreeable manners; he expends much money in the erection
of Pagodas, while he leaves the streets, roads and bridges by which
the ravines are passed, in a ruinous and disgraceful state.</p>
<p>The Bazaar of Bamo is generally well supplied: British piece goods
and woollen cloths are procurable, but at a high price: the show of
Chinese manufactures is much better, particularly on the arrival of
a caravan; considerable quantities of Tea are likewise brought in the
shape of flat cakes, of the size of a dessert plate, and about two inches
thick.&nbsp; This tea is of the black sort, and although very inferior
to the Chinese case teas, is a far better article than that of Pollong.&nbsp;
In addition to this, warm jackets lined with fur, straw hats, silk robes,
skull-caps, and sugar-candy are procurable; pork of course is plentiful,
and is excessively fat; grain, vegetables and fish are plentiful.&nbsp;
On the whole Bamo is a busy and rather flourishing place: it derives
its consequence entirely from its being a great emporium of trade with
the Chinese, who come here annually in large numbers; for the accommodation
of these people and their caravans, two or three squares, fenced in
with bamboos, are allotted.</p>
<p>The principal article of Burmese export is cotton, and this I believe
is produced for the most part lower down the Irrawaddi.</p>
<p>The climate of Bamo is in April dry and sultry: the range of the
thermometer being from 66&deg; or 68&deg; to 94&deg; or 96&deg;.&nbsp;
North-westers are of common occurrence in this month, and are frequently
of extreme severity.&nbsp; I saw very little cultivation about Bamo,
some of the ravines alluded to had lately been under rice-culture; the
chief part of the cultivation for vegetables, etc. is confined to the
sandy islands, which occur here and there.</p>
<p>Of the numerous villages passed between Bamo and Ava not one deserves
especial notice, nor is there one, with the exception of Umeerapoora,
the former capital, which contains 500 houses.&nbsp; Shewegyoo, which
formerly occupied a considerable extent of the left bank near the south
opening of the second Kioukdweng had been burnt by the orders of the
Monein Myoowoon, on account of their having supplied troops to the emissaries
of the Tharawaddi.&nbsp; Kioukgyee, the residence of the above governor,
had a short time before our arrival been invested by a force in the
interest of the Tharawaddi, but had been repulsed.&nbsp; The governor
was to proceed with the whole population, amounting to several hundred
souls, to Bamo, to join his forces with those of the Bamo governor.&nbsp;
This part of the country was most unsettled and almost deserted.&nbsp;
On reaching Katha the state of the country was more tranquil, all the
people below this point having espoused the cause of the Tharawaddi.&nbsp;
Katha contains 200 houses, and has a rather respectable bazaar; it is
well situated, and has the most eligible site in my opinion, of all
the towns hitherto seen.&nbsp; The most remarkable object is a noble
Kioung, or Mosque, built by the head-man of the place; this is one of
the finest now existing in Burma.</p>
<p>The only other large place is Sheenmaga, about a day&rsquo;s journey
from Ava.&nbsp; This is said to contain 1,000 houses.&nbsp; An extensive
fire had lately occurred here.&nbsp; I counted 200 houses, and judging
from the extent of the ruins, I should say it might probably have numbered
between 4 and 500.&nbsp; There are several villages contiguous to this,
and I think that the district immediately contiguous is more populous
than any part hitherto seen.</p>
<p>During the above portion of the journey our halts were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<pre> 1.  Tapaw.
 2.  Mogoung river.
 3.  Mogoung river.
 4.  Lemar, in the upper Kioukdweng.
 5.  Bamo.
 6.  Tsenkan.
 7.  Kioukgyee.
 8.  Katha.
 9.  Tsagaya.
10.  Tagoung.
11.  Mal&eacute;, at the entrance of the lower Kioukdweng.
12.  Kabuet, in the lower Kioukdweng.
13.  Mal&eacute;.
14.  Menghoon.
15.  Ava.</pre>
<p>This distance down the Irrawaddi may, in a fast boat, be performed
in ten days, but owing to the disturbed state of the country we were
compelled to avail ourselves of the first opportunity that offered to
enable us to reach Ava; in addition the proper number of boatmen was
not procurable, everybody being afraid of approaching the capital even
a few miles.</p>
<p>The chief product I saw was Teak, of this there were large rafts
at Tsenkan and elsewhere.&nbsp; This tree seems to abound in the hills
forming the NE. boundaries of Burmah.&nbsp; I did not, however, see
any of large size.</p>
<p>Tea is found on hills to the east of Bamo, and at a distance of one
day&rsquo;s journey from that place.&nbsp; Through the kindness of Mr.
Bayfield, I was enabled to procure specimens; the leaves were decidedly
less coarse, as well as smaller, than those of the Assamese plants,
and they occurred both serrated and entire.&nbsp; No use is made of
the wild plants in this direction, and the Chinese at Bamo, asserted
that it was good for nothing.&nbsp; It must be remembered, however,
that none of them had seen the plant cultivated in China.&nbsp; Indeed
the only real Chinaman we saw, was one at Kioukgyee, serving the Myoowoon
as a carpenter: this man had been to England twice, and talked a little
English.</p>
<p>Cotton is, I was informed, extensively cultivated.</p>
<p>But the most valuable product is the Ruby, which is procured from
hills to the eastward of Tsenbo, and which are, I believe, visible from
the opposite town, Mala.&nbsp; From the same place and to the SE., low
hills are visible, from which all the marble in extensive use for the
carving of images, is obtained; this marble has been pronounced by competent
authority to be of first-rate quality.</p>
<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;This must be considered as scanty.&nbsp;
From a list of towns and villages, observed by Captain Hannay, between
Ava and Mogoung inclusive, I estimated the population at 100,000 souls,
but from this one-third at least must be deducted.&nbsp; In this estimate
of the number of houses, Captain Hannay was probably guided, either
by the Burmese census, or by the statement of the writer who accompanied
him.&nbsp; From the numbers given by this officer, in almost every case
one-third, and occasionally one-half, or even more, must be deducted:
as instances, I may cite his statement of the number of houses in Bamo
and Katha.</p>
<p>In almost every case Mr. Bayfield counted all the houses, and in
all doubtful cases, I counted them also at his request, so that I am
enabled to speak with great confidence on this point.</p>
<p>As a collateral proof of the scanty population of this extensive
portion of the Burmese territory, I may allude to the fact that Bamo,
the third place in Burmah, and the emporium of great part of an extensive
Chinese trade, contains only even at the rate of seven souls to each
house, which is two too many, 4,250 inhabitants.&nbsp; The capital may
be adduced as an additional instance; for including the extensive suburbs,
no one estimated it as having a larger population than 100,000.&nbsp;
It must be remembered also, that there is no doubt, but that the banks
of the Irrawaddi are more populous than any other portion of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Throughout the above rather long journey, we were treated, with one
exception, tolerably well; indeed our delays arose from the unwillingness,
real or pretended, of the authorities to forward us on while the country
remained so unsettled.&nbsp; The headman of Kamein on our first arrival
was extremely civil, but on our return after he had received news of
the revolt of the Tharawaddi, he behaved with great insolence, and actually
drew his dha on Mr. Bayfield.&nbsp; It must be remembered however that
he had been brought to task by the Mogoung authorities for having, as
it was said, accepted of a douceur for allowing us to proceed to the
serpentine mines.</p>
<p>The general idea entertained by the people through whose countries
we passed, was, that we had been sent to report upon the country prior
to its being taken under British protection.&nbsp; Of the existence
of this idea, Mr. Bayfield met with some striking proofs.</p>
<p>On reaching Katha our troubles ceased, and these, excepting at Kamein
and Mogoung, only arose from the evident wish of the natives to keep
at a distance from us, and not to interfere in one way or the other.&nbsp;
At Mogoung I consider it probable that we should have been detained
had it not been for the firm conduct of Mr. Bayfield, and his great
knowledge of the Burmese character.&nbsp; At this place the authority
of the Myoowoon, who was absent in Hookhoong, was totally disregarded,
and his brother the Myoowoah, was in confinement, the Shan Matgyee having
espoused the cause of the prince Tharawaddi.</p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i>.&mdash;For the brief and rapid manner in which
I have run through this last section of my report, as well as for having
forsaken the arrangement adopted in the previous sections, I trust I
shall be excused.&nbsp; In the first place, this portion of the route
had been previously travelled over by Captain Hannay and by Mr. Bayfield,
by whom much additional information will be laid before Government;
and in the second place, I would advert to the hurried nature of this
part of our journey, and to the disturbed state of the country.&nbsp;
For similar reasons I have only drawn up this account to the period
of my reaching Ava.&nbsp; It will be at once seen that the information
might have been much more extensive, especially as regards the revenues
of the districts, but I abstained from interfering with subjects which
were in every respect within the province of Mr. Bayfield; and the minute
and accurate manner in which this officer performed the duties consigned
to him, reconciled me at once to the secondary nature of the objects
which were left for my examination.</p>
<p>I subjoin a tabular view of the marches, this will not agree entirely
with those given in the body of the report, as one or two of those were
unavoidably short.&nbsp; I give the table to shew the shortest period
in which the journey could be accomplished by an European without constantly
overfatiguing himself.&nbsp; If the total distance be compared with
an estimate made from charts, all of which however are imperfect so
far as the country between Meinkhoong and Beesa is concerned, the tortuousness
of our course will be at once evident.</p>

<p>Allowing twelve days for the performance of this last portion, which
however is too short a time, the entire distance may be performed in
forty days.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p><i>Notes</i> <i>made</i> <i>on</i> <i>descending</i> <i>the</i> <i>Irrawaddi</i>
<i>from</i> <i>Ava</i> <i>to</i> <i>Rangoon</i>.</p>
<p><i>28th</i> <i>May</i>.&mdash;I left Ava and halted about two miles
above Menboo.</p>
<p><i>29th</i> <i>May</i>.&mdash;Continuing the journey, the country
appears flat with occasionally low hills as about Kioukloloing, no large
villages occur; the river is sub-divided by churs; no large grasses
to be seen, and the vegetation is arid.&nbsp; Bombax is the chief tree:
Mudar and Zizyphus occur: Guilandina, Crotolaria a large Acanthacea,
and a Jasminioides shrub are the most common plants: Borassus is abundant:
Fici occur about villages.&nbsp; The banks are generally sandy, not
high.</p>
<p>Yandebo.&nbsp; This is a wretched village; barren plains bounded
to the east by barren rather elevated hills; base jungly.&nbsp; Observed
the tree under which the treaty was signed with the Burmese at the close
of the late war.&nbsp; It is an ordinary mango, near a pagoda on a plain
with two large fig trees.&nbsp; I counted to-day 28 boats sailing up
between this and our halting place of yesterday, mostly large praows.&nbsp;
The banks present few trees, are flat, barren, and from being occasionally
overflowed, adapted to paddy.</p>
<p>Halted at Meengian, which is a middling sized village on the left
bank, about a mile below Tarof myoo.</p>
<p><i>30th</i> <i>May</i>.&mdash;I made an excursion into the country
which is dry, barren, and sandy, with a descent towards the banks of
the river.&nbsp; Zizyphus, Acacia, Euphorbia 20 feet high, Calotropis,
Capparis 2, etc., occur all the same as before, only one Ehretiacea
appears to be new.&nbsp; Hares are very common.&nbsp; Likewise red and
painted Partridges, and Quail.&nbsp; Carthamus and Tobacco are cultivated,
specially the latter at Meengian.&nbsp; The most common tree here, is
Urticea procera? which has always a peculiar appearance.&nbsp; The country
towards Pukoko becomes prettier, the left bank wooded, and the ground
sloped very gradually up to Kionksouk, which is barren, and 2,000 feet
high at least, with the slopes covered with jungle.</p>
<p><i>31st</i> <i>May</i>.&mdash;Passed Pagam, a straggling town of
some size, famous for its numerous old pagodas of all sorts.&nbsp; The
surface of the country is raviny, and the vegetation continues precisely
the same.&nbsp; Below Pagam, the range of low hills becomes very barren:
altogether the country is very uninteresting.</p>
<p>The low range of hills on the right bank is nearly destitute of vegetation.&nbsp;
The hills present a curious appearance of ridges, sometimes looking
like walls.&nbsp; The country continues the same.</p>
<p>Halted opposite Yowa.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;A low range of hillocks here occurs
on the left bank, and as in other places, consisting of sandstone with
stunted and scanty vegetation.</p>
<p>Tselow is a large place on the left bank, the river is here much
spread out, with large sand banks.&nbsp; The hills on the right bank
present the same features; passed Pukangnai, a large village on the
left bank.&nbsp; Passed Pukkoko, Pagam, Tselow, etc., the hills about
this last place abound with Prionites.&nbsp; Strong wind prevails.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Yeanangeown 10 A.M.&nbsp; The country
continues exactly similar to that already observed&mdash;hillocks intersected
by ravines, loose sandstone, very barren in appearance.&nbsp; Vegetation
is the same, but more stunted; fossil wood is common, especially in
the bottom of ravines. <a name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147">{147}</a>&nbsp;
Of fossils very few were seen, but more are to be procured by digging.&nbsp;
The most common trees are Zizyphus, Acacia, and a Capparis: the most
common grass Aristida.&nbsp; Arrived at Yeanangeown, a busy place judging
from the number of boats.</p>
<p>Wind less strong.&nbsp; At 2 P.M. stopped at Wengma-thoat, where
Zizyphus is extremely common.&nbsp; Euphorbia seems rather disappearing.</p>
<p>The plants met with at the halting place six miles above Yeanang,
were Euphorbia, Olax, Zizyphus, Mimosa, Carissa, Ximenia, Prionites,
Calotropis, Gymnema, Capparis pandurata et altera species arborea, Murraya
rare, Gossypium frutex 6-8-petal, Xanthophyllum blue, petiolis alatis
of Tagoung, Sid&aelig; sp.&nbsp; On the right bank flat churs continue
covered with a small Saccharum.&nbsp; Vegetation more abundant and greener
than before.&nbsp; Ficus again occurs and Stravadium occasionally.</p>
<p>Passed 5 P.M. Memboo at a large village on right bank, containing
perhaps 200 houses.&nbsp; The river below this runs between two ranges
of low hills, similar in every respect to those already passed.&nbsp;
A Kukkeen woman was observed, who appeared to have a blue face, looking
perfectly frightful.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Maguay.&nbsp; Reached this place at
8 P.M.&nbsp; It is on the left bank.&nbsp; It is a place of some importance.&nbsp;
Many boats lying in the stream.&nbsp; The country, is of the same dry,
arid description: the banks of the river are however lower than previously
observed.</p>
<p>Passed Esthaiya, a small village on the right bank, at 6 A.M.&nbsp;
Adelia nereifolia continues common in some places.</p>
<p>Dhebalar, Meemgoon, two villages nearly opposite, neither of these
villages large.&nbsp; Ficus and Bombax are common; no Euphorbia was
observed.</p>
<p>We are now evidently getting within the influence of the Monsoon,
as the vegetation is more green.</p>
<p>Passed Mellun, a village on the right bank.&nbsp; The hills on either
side of the river are higher and better wooded than before observed,
and the river itself is not more than 350 yards broad.</p>
<p>Observed gold washers below Meegyoung-yea, where they find gold,
silver, and rubies by washing the sands.&nbsp; Here Bombax is very common
on the right bank.</p>
<p>Passed Thembounwa, a village on the left bank.&nbsp; The country
presents the same ridges of singular hills formed of veins of slaty,
tabular, brown rock, this is very conspicuous at Thembounwa.&nbsp; The
hills on the left bank above Meeaday are very barren; the banks rocky.</p>
<p>Halted at Khayoo, just above Meeaday, at 7 P.M.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Passed Teiyet myoo, a village on the
right bank, which seems to have some cotton trade; the houses along
the bank are wretched in appearance.&nbsp; Meeaday was passed during
a squall, I was thus prevented from making any observation on it.&nbsp;
Teiyet is the largest place I have seen.&nbsp; The country we are now
passing is very slightly undulated, soil light and sandy.&nbsp; Fine
tamarind trees occur, also Terminalia.&nbsp; In addition to the usual
plants a Lagerstr&aelig;mia occurs, which attains the size of a middling
tree, and a frutescent Hypericum, Aristolochia, and Hedyotis occur.&nbsp;
Strong south wind prevails so that we can make no progress whatever,
I therefore went into the jungle and found Stravadium, a fine Bignonia
foliis pinnatis, floribus maximis, fere spitham. infundibulif. subbilabiat.
lacinus crispatis: one or two Acanthace&aelig;, two Gramine&aelig;,
two Vandelli&aelig;, Bonnaya, Herpestes, Monniera, Rumex, Dentella,
three or four Cyperace&aelig;, Ammannia, Crotalaria on sand banks, Triga
in woods and Bauhinia, Dioscoria, a pretty herbaceous perennial Ardisia,
etc.&nbsp; We have not made two miles since breakfasting at Teiyet,
about four hours ago.&nbsp; Convolvulus pileatus and dwarf bamboo are
common on the low hills.&nbsp; The Lagerstr&aelig;mia has petals none,
or minute squamiform.</p>
<p>Reached Caman Myoo, a village on the right bank, at 7 P.M.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Many boats are here, owing to there
being an excellent place of anchorage in still water, protected by an
Island, but there are not many houses in the village.</p>
<p>Below, the river again becomes confined between hills, but above
this it expands.&nbsp; These hills are rather bare: no Euphorbia exists,
and the whole vegetation is changed.</p>
<p>Now passing hills, chiefly covered with bamboos.&nbsp; Bignonia crispa
occurs, and a Scilloid plant out of flower is common.&nbsp; Aroideum,
similar to that of Katha, is common, a new species is likewise found,
but it is a Roxburghia, and rare.</p>
<p>Stravadium has very minute stipules, the habit and gemmation is that
of Ternstr&aelig;miace&aelig;, and it perhaps connects this order with
Myrtace&aelig;; Punica from this is certainly distinct, owing pr&aelig;ter
alia to its valvate calyx.&nbsp; Soneratia belongs I suspect to Lythrarie&aelig;,
connecting it with Myrtace&aelig;.</p>
<p>The Roxburghia above alluded to, is a distinct genus.</p>
<p>Planta quam juniorem tantum vidi vex spitham&aelig;a.&nbsp; Radices
plurim&aelig; filiformes, cortice crassa, tenacissima obfibras foliiformas
ad vaginam redacta, superiora petiolique purpureo-brunnei, vernatione
involutiva, flores solitarii in axillis foliorum et vaginarum, albi
carneo tincti.&nbsp; Pedicellis subtereti apice, articulatis, monoicis.</p>
<p>Perianth sub-companulat, 4-sepalum, sepalis lanceolato-oblongis a
medio reflexis, estivat imbricat.</p>
<p>Stam. 4. sepalis alterna, filam subanth. magna, subsagittat, connectivo
magno supra in apiculum longum product, et inter loculos in carinam
(carneam) purpuream, loculi angustissimi, viridis, alabastrus lutescens.&nbsp;
Pollen viridescens.&nbsp; F&aelig;min flos, infimus, unum tantum vidi
sepala longiora herbacea, stam. 0.</p>
<p>Ovarium compressum, fol. carpell () <a name="citation149"></a><a href="#footnote149">{149}</a>,
stylus conicus, ovar viridis, stigma sub-simplex.</p>
<p>Char. gen. Flores monoici Per. 4, sepalum, stam. 4.</p>
<p>Arrived at Prome on the left bank, the stockade seemed to be out
of repair: the water front of the stockade is about 800 yards in length:
it extends about 200 yards back from the river, and beyond the hill
on which are pagodas: opposite the pagodas it is of brick, and beyond
this a long line of houses or huts extends; there is no appearance of
improvement going on.&nbsp; The hills on the opposite side present the
same features, trees just commencing to leaf; every thing indicates
a temporary sterility caused by the long hot season.&nbsp; Above this
place we passed a village extending 500 yards along the river.&nbsp;
Cocoa trees thrive well here, and are not uncommon.&nbsp; Borassus continues.</p>
<p>Shwe Doung, 6 miles from Prome, is as large as Prome itself: the
country beyond this expands; no hills were seen near this part of the
river; some way below Palmyras are common; Bombax, Ficus, and Tamarind
are the chief trees.</p>
<p>Passed Reedan, a straggling place on the left bank.&nbsp; A range
of hills occur, extending close along the right bank, and which, as
well as the distant ones, are wooded to the summit, as the hills are
on the Malay Coast.</p>
<p>Passed Thengyee, a village on the right bank.&nbsp; Hills at this
place approach close to the river for a short way, but soon cease.&nbsp;
They are covered with Teak, scarped, and many images are carved in the
recesses of the rock, apparently sandstone.&nbsp; Thengyee, just below
this, seems to be a great place for boat-building.</p>
<p>Halted at Talownmo at 7&frac12; P.M.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;At this place there are no hills near
the river, which is sub-divided by islands.&nbsp; Painted partridge
continues.&nbsp; Kioungee; palmyra trees continue in plenty.&nbsp; Talipat
never seen dead, but with its inflorescence.&nbsp; Passed Meavion and
Runaown.&nbsp; Palmyras here occur: great numbers of boats passing up
and down.&nbsp; Traffic considerable.</p>
<p>Moneu, a village on the left bank, at which many boats were observed.</p>
<p>The river banks throughout are today flat and alluvial, and those
of the Islands are covered with moderate sized grasses; extreme banks
jungly.&nbsp; Palmyras continue.</p>
<p>Halted at Thendan, on left bank.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;The country here has the usual alluvial
features; few villages are seen, but as the river is sub-divided, one
must not judge from this and the consequent barren appearance, that
the country is less populated than above.</p>
<p>Stravadium is common in the woods: on the banks, noticed Acrostichum
difforme; Epiphytical Orchide&aelig; are common.&nbsp; Urticea fructibus
late obcordatis.</p>
<p>Passed Tharawa, a village on the left bank, and Theenmaga myoo on
the right bank, which seems a large place; here Pandanus commences.&nbsp;
Palmyras were seen, together with a few Areca.&nbsp; At 4 P.M. I saw
at Zulone myoo, for the first time during the descent, a Crocodile,
which is an indication of our approach to the coast.&nbsp; A Bombax
is now common on some of the islands, the banks are now generally grassy.</p>
<p>This Bombax is apparently the same as that of Assam; the river here
resembles the B. pootur about Chykwar.</p>
<p>Halted at a small village about six miles above Donai-byoo near Dollong.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>8th</i>.&mdash;Donai-byoo, 7 A.M.&nbsp; This is a
large place, on the right bank, having a good many boats.</p>
<p>Niown Sheedouk on the left bank, three miles below Donai-byoo, is
likewise a large place.</p>
<p>Tides exist here, and their influence extends upwards as far as Zulone,
that is to say, the stream is much diminished during the flood.&nbsp;
Entered Rangoon river at 1 P.M.: it is here not more than 200 yards
broad.&nbsp; Nioungdoa is a middling sized village, situated about a
mile from the mouth or entrance, at which were observed plenty of boats.&nbsp;
The banks of the river are here grassy; tall Saccharum and Arundo occur,
but not so large as those of Assam.&nbsp; The river a small way below
the mouth is not more than 100 yards wide.&nbsp; Bombax and Ficus are
the most common trees: Lagerstr&aelig;mia grandiflora forms a little
tree jungle: Butea likewise occurs.</p>
<p>Passed Tsamaloukde, a small village on the right bank.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Halted at 6 this morning at a small
village on the left bank.&nbsp; The features of the country now become
paludosal.&nbsp; Acanthus ilicifolius, Cynometra acacisides, Cyperace&aelig;,
Soneralia acida, Avicennia, Stravadium, Croton malv&aelig;folium are
very common, Creni sp. C&aelig;salpinia, and a leguminous tree, fructibus
1-spermis, drupaceis, Webera, Premna, Cissi sp. potius <i>Vitis</i>,
Clerodendri sp. Heritiera fomes, Flagellaria indica, Hibisci species
populne&aelig; affinis, Arundo, Ambrosinia 2 species.</p>
<p>Country open, low, and quite flat, admirable for rice cultivation.</p>
<p>Crinoid giganteum, Exc&aelig;caria, Agallocha, no Rhizophores, Ipom&aelig;a
floribus maximis, hypocrateriform, albis, foliis cordatis.&nbsp; Soneratia
apetala less common, but becomes more so as we approach Rangoon, it
is an elegant tree with pendulous branchlets.&nbsp; Heritiera is very
common and conspicuous when in flower, it is then of a yellow brown
tint; Acrostichum aureum, Calamus, and Lomaria scandens occur.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<p><i>Journal</i> <i>towards</i> <i>Assam</i> <i>and</i> <i>to</i> <i>Bootan&mdash;contains</i>
<i>notes</i> <i>on</i> <i>distribution</i> <i>of</i> <i>Plants</i>.</p>
<p>Left Calcutta a second time on the 31st August 1837, arrived at Serampore
on the 1st September, and spent the day with the Voights.</p>
<p><i>September</i> <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Continue on the Hooghly: paddy
cultivation prevails and Crotalaria juncea; this last is sown broadcast
in low places, but not quite so low as paddy.&nbsp; Bengallees are but
slovenly husbandmen; grass, etc. collected by them in small cocks, and
covered with a small thatch, which answers its purpose as well as a
narrow brimmed hat would answer that of an umbrella.&nbsp; Broken earthenware
not unfrequently visible in the banks, in some places at the depth of
3-4 feet.&nbsp; Unsettled weather, with gusts of strong wind from the
S. and SSE.&nbsp; Thermometer 78&deg; 82'.&nbsp; The usual Calcutta
birds continue, jackdaw-like crow, Falco pondicherainus, two common
mainas, Ardea indica, and the white one.</p>
<p>Came on the Ganges about noon; on passing Chobda had the horror of
seeing the bodies of burning Hindoos, the friends who are present at
these funeral rites turning them about with sticks, so as to give each
side its share of fire.&nbsp; The women bathe in their ordinary dresses:
these though ample are of fine cotton fabric, so that when wet more
of the shape is disclosed than is deemed desirable in Europe, but exposure
of person has no repugnant effect on Asiatics.</p>
<p>The Matabangah is a small, very tortuous, stream, not exceeding 70
yards in breadth: the banks are low, either wooded to the edge or covered
with grass, such as Cynodon.&nbsp; Excellent pasturage prevails, as
indicated by the number of cows.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Wind SE.&nbsp; There are not many
villages in the vicinity of the river; passed yesterday Kranighat, where
there is a toll, from which officers on duty are exempt; but as no precautions
seem to be taken to keep the river clear, no toll whatever should be
taken: although the latter is high, the receipts must be very small.&nbsp;
Passed Arskally about noon, the banks are composed occasionally of pure
sand, and the country becomes more open, with very little jungle, much
indigo cultivation occurs.&nbsp; Thermometer 78&deg; 85'.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Wind SW.&nbsp; The country continues
the same as before.&nbsp; At 2 P.M., we reached Krishnapoor.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>6th</i>.&mdash;8 A.M.&nbsp; We left the Matabangah
river and entered a less tortuous nullah.&nbsp; The country continues
the same.&nbsp; Much indigo cultivation still occurs.&nbsp; We saw yesterday
evening a large herd of cows swim across the Matabangah; they were led
by a bull, who kept turning round every now and then to see whether
his convoy was near him.&nbsp; Today I saw a rustic returning from his
labours, with his plough thrown easily across his shoulders; to a strong
Englishman the feat of walking home with such a plough, cattle, and
all would not be very difficult.&nbsp; Indigo is cut about a foot from
the ground, then tied in bundles.&nbsp; Water for steeping it in is
raised from the rivers by something like chair-buckets, only the buckets
are represented by flat pieces of wood, the whole is turned on an axle
by the tread of men; the water is carried upon an inclined narrow plane;
the machine answers its purpose very well, and the natives work it with
great dexterity.&nbsp; At 5 P.M., we came on a stream 100 yards wide,
down which we proceeded.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, <i>7th</i>.&mdash;The country continues much the
same.&nbsp; Of birds the black and white peewit is not uncommon;&mdash;cormorants,
etc. also occur.&nbsp; P.M.&nbsp; Thermometer 90&deg;.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>8th</i>.&mdash;The country is more low and more
sub-divided by rivers than before.&nbsp; Abundance of indigo.&nbsp;
Pumps also used, as before observed, for raising water.&nbsp; Passed
Moodoo Kully at 5 P.M., and left its river for a small nullah.&nbsp;
Indigo abundant on all sides throughout the day&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Continue in this nullah.&nbsp;
Country wooded.&nbsp; Ph&aelig;nix sylvestris very abundant: Areca Catechu
also becoming abundant.&nbsp; A good deal of cultivation occurs, mottled
chiefly with sugar-cane and vegetables.&nbsp; The habits of the black
and white kingfisher, Alcedo rudis, are different from those of the
other Indian species: it never perches, choosing rather the ground to
rest upon: it builds in banks: takes its prey by striking it from a
height of 20 feet or thereabouts, previously fluttering or hovering
over it.&nbsp; The size and figure of this bird when resting on the
ground, resembles the two common Indian Terns.</p>
<p>Palms, contrary to what might be supposed from the nature of these
plants, can put forth additional buds;&mdash;this is exemplified in
ph&aelig;nix sylvestris, the stems of which are deeply and alternately
notched by the natives for procuring toddy.&nbsp; When this is carried
to a great extent, the tree either dies or a new apex is formed laterally.&nbsp;
The old notches, as might be expected, at length, become much obliterated.&nbsp;
It is from the study of such palms that much light will be thrown on
the growth of monocotyledonous stems.&nbsp; The vegetation of jheels
is now obviously commencing.&nbsp; Pistia stratioles, Nymph&aelig;a,
Potamogeton, Potamochloa, Oplismenus stagninus, and Villarsia occur.&nbsp;
Reached Furreedpore at 7 P.M.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>10th</i>.&mdash;Came on the Paddo, an immense stream
1&frac12; miles wide, with a very strong current, about a mile to the
East of Furreedpore.&nbsp; Lagerstr&aelig;mia Regina here occurs.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, <i>11th</i>.&mdash;The country is become much lower
since leaving Furreedpore, and is inundated during the height of the
rains.&nbsp; The peculiar vegetation of jheels predominant; that of
the jungle continues much the same.&nbsp; Plhugoor continues plentiful.&nbsp;
No palmyras.&nbsp; Mangoes plentiful, but small.&nbsp; Passed a deserted
Roman Catholic Chapel, and Priest&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; White-winged
long-nailed water-hens becoming plentiful.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>12th</i>.&mdash;The country abounds more in jheels:
in many places nothing is visible but water, in which huge plains of
floating grasses occur.&nbsp; The villages are very numerous, and occupy
in fact almost every spot of ground not subject ordinarily to inundation.&nbsp;
Damasonium Indicum, Nymph&aelig;a pubescens occur in profusion.&nbsp;
The grass which exists in such vast quantities is, I believe, Oplismenus
stagninus.&nbsp; The water of these jheels is clear, black when deep,
which it often is to a great extent.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>13th</i>.&mdash;Reached Dacca about 2 P.M.:
it is a large and populous place.&nbsp; The numerous grass of the jheels
is sown there: it is the red bearded <i>dhan</i> or paddy grass: of
this vast quantities are cut for fodder, for, the whole face of the
country being overflowed, it follows that the cattle are throughout
the rains kept in stalls.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Left about noon, and proceeded
down the Dacca river about 5 miles, then diverged into a narrow creek
running nearly south.&nbsp; Along this were observed fine specimens
of tamarind trees.&nbsp; Stravadium in abundance.&nbsp; Sonninia scandens,
and Mango, both in abundance.&nbsp; Passed at 5 P.M. Neerangunge, a
large native town, and below it Luckepoor.&nbsp; A vast expanse of water
appeared near this, viz., the Megna.&nbsp; A good deal of native shipping
occurs, consisting of brigs: great quantities of rice being exported
from both places.&nbsp; Pelicans I observed here to roost in trees.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p154.jpg">
<img alt="View in the jheels" src="images/p154.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Friday, 15th.&mdash;In the midst of jheels: the whole face of the
country is covered with water several feet deep.&nbsp; Vast quantities
of Oplismenus stagninus still occur.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>16th</i>.&mdash;Still in jheels.&nbsp; The same
features continue.&nbsp; The country is still very populous, all the
more elevated spots having villages.&nbsp; Oplismenus stagninus still
prevails in vast quantities.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Jheels in every direction:&mdash;nothing
indeed seen but water, with occasional grassy or reedy, and elevated
spots occupied by villages:&mdash;here and there a round-headed tree
springing apparently out of the water.&nbsp; Hills visible to the east.&nbsp;
Cormorants, Ciconia nudiceps, paddy-birds, the common white ones with
black feet, are abundant, and associate in flocks: there is one very
nearly allied to this, which is solitary, having black feet with yellow
toes.&nbsp; The boats of this district are very simple, something like
a Bengal <i>dingy</i> reversed, but they are sharp in the bows and ought
to be fast; their only mode of progression is to be pushed along by
means of poles.&nbsp; There appears to be a great number of Mussulmans,
who would here seem to form the majority of the population.&nbsp; Strong
winds from the south interrupt our progress.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, <i>18th</i>.&mdash;Delayed by bad weather.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>19th</i>.&mdash;Continued to pass through same
kind of country, but less jheelly.&nbsp; The Cook boat was left behind
on the 17th in a squall, and has not come up yet, so that I dine with
the boatmen.</p>
<p>The black and white long-toed water-hen continues plentiful: when
alarmed by kites, etc. it pursues them uttering a low mournful scream,
until it has succeeded in getting its enemy off to some distance; it
then returns, I suppose to its young; otherwise its cry is something
like the mewing of a cat, or rather a low hollow moan.&nbsp; The hills
are plainly visible to-day, lying towards the north.</p>
<p>The males of the white and black water-hen have tails something like
those of a pheasant.&nbsp; There are two other species: one that is
found on the Tenasserim coast; the other is much larger,&mdash;the size,
of a large domestic fowl: one of the sexes, has red wattles on its head.&nbsp;
The white and black one is far the most common; it feeds apparently,
in flocks: the Maulmain one is the least common.&nbsp; These with Ardea
Indica, the white, black-toed, yellow-beaked Ardea, Ciconia nudiceps
a small brown <i>chat</i>?, Pica vagabunda, are the birds of the jheels
or rather the dry spots in them.&nbsp; I saw yesterday a flock of the
black Ibis, flying <i>in</i> <i>a</i> <i>triangle</i> (&gt;) <i>without</i>
<i>a</i> <i>base</i>, the party was headed by one of the white paddy-birds!&nbsp;
Villages have become very numerous, and the population abundant and
flourishing.&nbsp; The cattle are, as I have said, stalled and fed with
paddy grass, quantities of boats being employed for its conveyance.&nbsp;
Oplismenus stagninus appears less common about here.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, <i>21st</i>.&mdash;Still among jheels; our progress
is necessarily very slow; we are indeed scarcely moving, there being
no tracking ground: jheels occur in every direction, although the hills
are not 15 miles distant.&nbsp; Pelicans with white and black marked
wings occur, together with the slate-colored eagle with white tail,
barred at tip with black; it is common in the low wooded places surrounded
by jheels.&nbsp; Black-bellied Tern occurs, but not that of Assam.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Arundo and two species of Saccharum
occur, among which S. spontaneum, is very common and of large size.&nbsp;
We reached the Soorma river about 12 o&rsquo;clock, 3 or 4 miles above
Mr. Inglis&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>I arrived at Chattuc on the 21st, which place I left for Pundoa the
following day.&nbsp; There are no mountains of this name as would seem
from the habitat of some plants given in Roxburgh&rsquo;s Flora Indica.&nbsp;
The mountains therein called Pundoa are the Khasya or Cossiah range;
Pundoa, is the name of a village called by the natives Puddoa.&nbsp;
The jheels are for a great part under cultivation.&nbsp; The paddy cultivation
is of two kinds; it is either sown in the jheels just at the commencement
of the inundation, or it is sown on higher portions, and then transplanted
into the jheels.&nbsp; Jarool, Lagerstr&aelig;mia Regina is the chief
timber, it comes from Kachar; it is a dear and not a durable wood.</p>
<p>Dalbergia bracteata, first appears, on low hills about Chattuc; there
is also a Grimmia here on the river banks.</p>
<p>Porpoises are often seen in the Soorma; alligators or crocodiles,
very rarely.</p>
<p>Jheels continue nearly to the foot of the mountains; these last are
not wooded more than half way up; the remaining wood being confined
to ravines, the ridges appearing as if covered with grass.&nbsp; Here
and there, scarped amphitheatres are visible, down which many fine cascades
may be seen to fall.</p>
<p>Arrived at Mr. Inglis&rsquo;s Bungalow at Pundoa about 3 P.M., and
here regulated my thermometers; temperature of boiling water taken with
the large thermometer 210&frac12;&deg;, by means of the one in wooden
case 210&frac12;&deg;, temperature of the air 92&frac12;&deg;, red case
thermometer indicated the boiling point at 206&deg;!! nor would the
mercury rise higher.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Commenced the ascent, from Terya
Ghat.&nbsp; Up to which point the country is perfectly flat low and
wet, covered for a great part with gigantic Sacchara; among which partridges
are common.&nbsp; Osbeckia nepalensis, Marlea begonifolia, Gouania,
Bignonia Indica, a Panax, Byttneria, Hedysarum gyrans, Pueraia, Mimosa
stipulacea, a very large Rottboellia, Bauheni&aelig; 2, Bombax, Tetranthera
arborea, Grewia sepiaria may all be observed.&nbsp; On the Terya river
among stones, and where it is a pure mountain stream Eugenia salicifolia,
as in the Upper Kioukdweng, between Terya and the foot of the hills
occurs; Alstonia, Ophioxylon, Trophis aspera, Urtica naucleiflora, Varec&aelig;
sp. Impatiens in abundance, oranges in groves occur; at the foot Cryptophragmium
venustum; rather higher, Argostemma, and Neckera are common; &AElig;schynanthus
fulgens, jack and sooparee commonly cultivated.&nbsp; Then Oxalis sensitiva,
a small tender Lycopodium; pine-apples, Pogonatherum crinitum; Gordonia
soon commences, probably at 400 feet.&nbsp; Polytrichum aloides appears
on banks with Gordonia; Eurya commences above the first cascade.&nbsp;
Choripetalum, Modecca, Sonerila about two-thirds up to Mahadeb, and
Commelina, C. bengalensis, and Anatherum muricatum continue to Mahadeb,
as also Andropogon acicularis, the Impatiens, etc.&nbsp; No change takes
place, in fact the vegetation being all tropical.&nbsp; Up to this place
thick tree jungle continues; the ridges sometimes are covered with grass,
either Saccharum, Anthistiria arundinacea or Manisuris; scarcely any
oaks occur.&nbsp; Euonymus occurs at Mahadeb.&nbsp; Beyond Mahadeb the
scene becomes changed especially after surmounting the first ridge,
the face of the hills is covered with grasses, interspersed with rocks;
the clumps of wooded vegetation being small, irregular, and composed
of barren looking stunted trees.</p>
<p>Above this ridge the country puts on the appearance of a table land.&nbsp;
At Mahadeb, Staurogyne, Ruellia Neesiana, and Cryptophragmium are common,
a little above these is a species of Zalacca; Impatiens bracteata is
very common from near the foot to beyond Mahadeb; but it becomes small
and disappears before Moosmai is reached.&nbsp; Cymbidium bambusifolium
commences 600 feet above Mahadeb.&nbsp; Linum trigynum commences at
Mahadeb; Scutellaria a little above, but I have found this at the foot.</p>
<p>Dianella is found 1,000 feet above Mahadeb, as also Camellia candata;
Plantago, and Eriocaulon 2 sp. appear about 500 feet above Mahadeb;
and continue to Churra.&nbsp; Randia, the common one, is found up to
4,000 feet.&nbsp; Cinchona gratissima appears at Moosmai.&nbsp; The
first Viburnum, also occurs here.&nbsp; Impatiens graminifolia a little
lower.&nbsp; Salomonia, which appears half way to Mahadeb, continues
to Moosmai and Churra, but is stunted.</p>
<p>Vaccinium, Ceratostemma, Crotalaria Hoveoides, Gnaphalia appear towards
Moosmai.&nbsp; Wendlandia at Moosmai.&nbsp; Ruellia persic&aelig;folia
straggles a little lower than these.&nbsp; Smithia commences at Moosmai;
Pandanus also; this is excessively common on hills to the left, towards
the caves.&nbsp; Dipsacus commences above Moosmai.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, <i>25th</i>.&mdash;Churra is situated in a plain surrounded
in every direction by low rounded hills, except to the E. and SE., on
which side there is a deep ravine, the whole plateau rising considerably
towards the north, in the direction of Churra itself.&nbsp; Ravines
exist here and there; it is along these, and the water-courses, that
the only woody vegetation is to be found.&nbsp; The rest of the surface
is clothed with grasses, of which a number of species exist, they are
chiefly Andropogone&aelig;.&nbsp; Two or three Osbeckias exist; a Tradescantia
(T. septem clavata) covers certain patches with its bright blue flowers.&nbsp;
Three species of Impatiens, two with bright pink flowers are common.&nbsp;
Spathoglottis, and Anthogonum occur on the flat rocks, which frequently
prevail; Arundinaria is seen every where as well as a Smithia? with
lotus-like blossoms.&nbsp; With regard to birds, the Motacilla or water-wagtails
are seen at Churra and at Pundoa, are generally of yellow colour in
place of white.</p>
<p>The woody vegetation consists of Berberis, Viburnum, Bucklandia,
Cleyera floribus fragrantis, petalis sepalis oppositis, Myrsine and
many others, too numerous indeed to mention.</p>
<p>The woods, towards Churra, assume that rounded and very determinate
form, which is seen so commonly in some parts of England, Bucks for
instance.&nbsp; None of the trees arrive to any great size.&nbsp; The
generality are low, rounded, and stunted.&nbsp; It is in these, that
Quercus, Viburnum, and Pandanus may be seen growing side by side.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Took the height of the station,
which I make to be 3,921 feet; temperature 74&deg;; water boiled at
205&deg;; in the small metal thermometer 198&deg;! centigrade 97&deg;;
large metal 205&frac14;&deg;; wooden scale 204&deg;.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Left for Surureem.&nbsp; On the
first height on which the village is situated, a Potentilla is to be
found, and this becomes more abundant as we continue to ascend.&nbsp;
The next European form that appears, is Fragaria, the height of which
may be estimated at 4,200 feet, this too becomes more common as we ascend;
Caryota may be seen, or at least, a palm tree, in ravines as high as
4,000 feet; Daucus appears at 4,300 feet in grassy plains; Prunella
at about the same, Gerardia at 4,500 feet; Gaultheria and an Impatiens
with very small yellow flowers at 4,800 feet, as well as Othonna.</p>
<p>With the exception of these, the vegetation is much the same as that
about Churra: but the Balsams of that place disappear almost towards
Surureem, as well as the Tradescantia 7-clavata.&nbsp; Plants which
are not in flower about Churra, are found towards Surureem in perfection.</p>
<p>After the first considerable ascent is surmounted, and which is probably
4,750 feet, the country becomes more barren, the grass more scanty and
less luxuriant.&nbsp; Spathoglottis, and Anthogonium disappear; Xyris
continues in abundance, likewise Eriocaulons, especially the middling-sized
one; Bucklandia becomes more common and more developed; a frutescent
Salix commences at 4,800 feet, as well as a Gramen Avenaceum vel Bromoideum.</p>
<p>Surureem is a small village, 100 feet above the rude bungalow, provided
for the few travellers who pass this way; close to it is to be found
Zanthoxylum and Hemiphragma, which last commences at Moosmai.&nbsp;
The simple leaved Rubus of Churra, petalis minutis carneis, has ceased;
a trifoliate one foliis cordato-rotundatis, existing instead.&nbsp;
Most of the grasses continue, but all are comparatively of small stature.&nbsp;
Two new Andropogonoids make their appearance: of Composit&aelig;, a
Tussilaginoid and a stout Senecionidea, the former not uncommon about
Churra, but out of flower.&nbsp; Salomonia ceased.</p>
<p>The height of Surureem I calculate at 4,978 feet; temperature 65&deg;
Fahr.; of centigrade 19&deg;; water boiled at 95&frac12;&deg; of centigrade;
203&deg; Fahr., wooden scale; 203&frac12;&deg; large metal; small ditto
195&frac12;&deg;!&nbsp; Temperature of the air at 6 P.M., 63&deg;.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;Temperature 6 A.M., 63&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp;
Left for Moflong.&nbsp; There is a considerable rise at first, then
the country is tolerably level until one reaches the Kala Panee, the
descent to this is about 7 or 800 feet, thence the rise is great, with
a corresponding descent to the Boga Panee, which I estimate at 4,457
feet, and which is certainly 1,000 feet below the highest ground passed
on this side of the Kala Panee.&nbsp; After crossing this torrent, by
means of a miserably unsteady wooden bridge, the ascent is very steep
for about 1,200 feet, thence there is a small descent to Moflong, which
I find to be 5,485 feet.&nbsp; Most of the plants continue.&nbsp; Tradescantia
and Commelina become much less common towards the Kala Panee, as well
as the Impatiens of Churra, but their place is supplied by others.&nbsp;
Along 100 yards of the Kala Panee, upwards of four species may be met
with.&nbsp; Polygonum (Bistorta) becomes more common on the higher ground
between Surureem and Kala Panee, thence diminishing in size and frequency.&nbsp;
Polygonum Rheoides becomes abundant towards a height of 5,200 feet,
when Pyrus, an apple-like species, and Spir&aelig;as make their appearance
at 5,300 feet.&nbsp; On the Kala Panee, Bucklandia re-appears, but thence
would seem to cease: on the brow of the ascent from this, Pedicularis
appears in abundance among grasses, with it <i>Sphacele</i>?&nbsp; At
the same height, which cannot be less than 5,400 feet, Carduus or Cnicus,
appears.&nbsp; Solidago commences in the valley of the Kala Panee, but
becomes more abundant at higher elevations.&nbsp; Sanguisorba appears
at 5,400 feet, but in small quantities, and at this height Anisadenia
recommences.&nbsp; Epilobium appears at 5,300 feet, continues at the
same elevation to Moflong, where it is common.&nbsp; On the descent
to the Boga Panee, an European form of Euphorbia appears at 5,000 feet
with Viola Patrinia and a Galium asperum.&nbsp; Hieracium appears at
about the same height.&nbsp; Cuscuta is very common from 5 to 5,500
feet, continuing even to Moflong; the scales of this genus are, it appears
to me, mere appendages of the filaments, and not due to non-development
or suppression of parts.&nbsp; Erythrina, which is found about Churra,
is seen on the road to Kala Panee, apparently quite wild; altitude 5,200
feet: it recommences at Moflong, where it is common about villages,
but never exceeds the size of a small tree.&nbsp; Commelina bengalensis?
continues throughout here and there, and may be found even about Moflong.</p>
<p>The most striking change occurs, however, in the Pines, which, although
of small stature, exist in abundance on the north side of the Boga Panee;
so far as may be judged of by the naked eye, they disappear on this
side, about a mile to the westward, very few cross the torrent, and
few indeed are found 100 feet above its bed on the south side.&nbsp;
I took the height of the bed of this torrent.&nbsp; Temperature of the
air 72&deg;; water boiled at 204&deg;; which gives the height about
4,400 feet.&nbsp; Between Surureem and the Boga Panee, many new plants
occur; grasses continue, as also at Moflong, the prevailing feature.&nbsp;
The principal new ones occur on the descent, consisting of two large
Andropogons, one closely allied to A. sch&aelig;ranthus and a tall Anthistiria
habitu A. arundinacea; a beautiful Saccharum occurs here and there,
especially before reaching the Kala Panee and the Gramina Bromoidea,
which is the only really European form.&nbsp; On the Kala Panee, scarcely
any Podostemon griffithia; except a few small ones, very few signs or
appearance of fresh plants.&nbsp; Along the Boga Panee, among the wet
rocks which form its banks, a fine Parnassia; a trailing Arbutoidea;
a very European looking Quercus; Anesadenia pubescens, a Circ&aelig;a,
Campanul&aelig; 2, &AElig;schynomene, Crotalaria, a Serissa?; this last
continuing to Moflong, a fine Osbeckia, and Gnaphalium aereonitus may
likewise be found.&nbsp; On the ascent, few new plants occur; Rhinanthoidea,
Osbeckia nepalensis, and capitata, Conyzoidea, Dipsacus, Gnaphalium
foliis linearibus, Crotolaria hoveoides, Colutoidea, Pteris (Aquilina.)
Scutellaria, Potentilla, Smilax occur at 5,000 feet with Plantago, Fragaria
and Artemisia, as well as lower down.&nbsp; The most striking plant
is a Delphinium, which, at about 5,000 feet, occurs stunted; this is
common about Moflong.</p>
<p>Agrimonia range from 3,500 to 5,500 feet, where they are very common,
Hypericum three sorts occur, H. myrtifolium commences, about Churra,
re-occurs here and there on the road to Moflong, about which it is very
common.&nbsp; H. ovalifolium, is more elevational, scarcely descending
below 5,000 feet; H. japonicum is found from towards Mahadeb to Moflong;
H. fimbriatum foliis decussatis, scarcely below 5,000 feet; Leucas galea
brunneo villosa on grassy hills is common towards Boga Panee, and continues
as high as Moflong.</p>
<p>Quercus commences about Mahadeb: a new species occurs on the edge
of woods towards the Kala Panee; altitude 5,000 feet; it nearly commences
with two Rhododendra, which, at least the arborescent one, arrives at
perfection on the Kala Panee.</p>
<p>Viburna continue; Salix (fruticose) commences about 5,000 feet, continues
here and there to Moflong.&nbsp; Buddleia Neemda is found about Churra,
but not commonly; and soon disappears.&nbsp; B. 4-alata commences beyond
the Churra Punjee, and continues as far as Moflong.</p>
<p>Thibaudia buxifolia becomes less common beyond 5,000 feet; other
forms of Ericine&aelig; appear in places about 5,000 feet, Gaultheria
continuing as far as Moflong.&nbsp; Eurya species alterum, commences
about the same elevation, continuing to Moflong.</p>
<p>Three species of Spir&aelig;a are found between Surureem and Moflong,
none perhaps below 5,000 feet; Prunella occurs about the same height,
continuing as far as Moflong.</p>
<p>On crossing the Boga Panee, the country becomes perhaps more undulated
and much more barren, scarcely any arborescent vegetation is to be seen,
the little woody vegetation consisting of stunted shrubs.&nbsp; Immediately
around Moflong, the country is excessively bare, not a tree is to be
seen, even the sides of ravines being clothed with stunted shrubs.&nbsp;
Berberis asiatica, Viburna, Spir&aelig;a <i>bella</i>? Eurya <i>camellifolia</i>,
Betula <i>corylifolia</i>.</p>
<p>To the north, fine woods are seen, and to the east, fir woods, the
nearest being about 4 miles off.&nbsp; The village is small and wretchedly
dirty, the paths being the worst of all I have seen on these hills.&nbsp;
The houses and the adjoining fields are surrounded with hedges of Colquhounia,
Erythrina, Buddl&aelig;a.</p>
<p>In waste places Colquhounia <i>micrantha</i>, Cysticapnos, Verbesina,
Pteris, Davallia, etc. are to be found, as well as Codonopsis viridiflora.&nbsp;
The hills are covered with low grass, almost a sward.&nbsp; On this,
Potentilla, Agrimonia, Geranium as well as in fields, Pisoideum floribus
cyaneis, Campanula, Aster disco azureo may be found; on low spots a
very small Parnassia, and a still smaller Isch&aelig;mum.</p>
<p>Ranunculus, one species, but this is uncommon; Delphinium is common
in thickets, etc.</p>
<p>The only cultivation is potatoes, a few years since introduced, and
which answers admirably, some turnips and Glycine tuberosa.&nbsp; Cattle,
goats and pigs abundant.</p>
<p>On the whole this is to be considered as the place where the peculiar
vegetation of Churra, arrives at its boundary, for although many of
the plants of the plains are to be found, they are all in a dwarf state.</p>
<p>Noticed a Hoopoo, but birds in general are not frequent.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p><i>Continues</i> <i>the</i> <i>Journey</i> <i>towards</i> <i>Assam</i>
<i>and</i> <i>Bootan</i>.</p>
<p>The annexed table of the distributions of plants in relation to altitudes
of the Khasyah mountains may render the subject of the preceding observations
more clear and distinct.&nbsp; The dotted line along the left hand margin
represents the elevation of the mountains, the greater height of which
is something better than 6,000 feet.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>8th</i>.&mdash;Visited the fir wood, which is about
three miles to the eastward; the road runs over the same <i>downey</i>
ground.&nbsp; The first plant that appears is a Boreal Euphorbia, allied
to that previously mentioned.&nbsp; A Sanguisorba of large stature occurs
in low wet places.&nbsp; Epilobum not uncommon.&nbsp; The Pines appear
first straggling, and they only form a wood in one place, and even there
not of much extent; none are of any size.&nbsp; Musci Lichens and fungi
abound in the wood, as also Circ&aelig;a and Herminium?</p>
<p>Osbeckia Nepalensis, Hedychia 2, a small Goodyera, Tricyrtis Hedera,
Polygonum, Polypodium, Gaultheria, Viburnum, Thibaudiacea fructibus
gratis, subacidis.&nbsp; Eurya, Valeriana, Quercus, may likewise be
found.&nbsp; Salix occurs on the skirts in low places.&nbsp; The hills
around are clothed with grasses, among which is a large Airoidea; in
the low valleys between these, intersected with small water-courses,
three species of Juncus, a curious Umbellifera fistulosa, and Mentha
verticillata, occur.&nbsp; Another Hypericum is likewise found in lately
cleared places.</p>
<p>Some cultivation occurs about the place on the slopes of hills, chiefly
of a Digitaria, sown broadcast, and tied up in bundles when nearly ripe;
together with Glycine tuberosa, and Coix Lacryme.</p>
<p>To the eastward the hills become more rocky, affording little vegetation,
the chief plant is an Othonnoidea; another Herminioidea, and a Habenariod,
both out of flower, may be found, the former on hills, the latter in
low places; a tall Campanula was among the new plants, and an Umbellifera
with curious foliage.</p>
<p>The height of this ridge is 5,768 feet, the temperature being 74&deg;,
and water boiling at 201&frac34;&deg;.</p>
<p>Took the elevation of Moflong bungalow.&nbsp; Temperature of the
air 65&deg;; water boiled at 202&frac14;&deg;; this gives 5,410 feet.</p>
<p>There are several high rounded hills about this place, (one to the
south of the Boga Panee,) the generality of which are more elevated
than those on the northern side; the most conspicuous is the hill near
Moleem, the north face of which is wooded, and which is at least 1,000
feet above Moflong.</p>
<p>8 P.M.&nbsp; Temperature 58&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp; 5 P.M. 65&deg;.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Rain as usual in the morning.&nbsp;
Thermometer at 7 A.M., 58&frac12;&deg;.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;A fine bracing cold morning, with
the thermometer at 53&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp; 7 A.M. left for Myrung.&nbsp;
The march to Syung is uninteresting, passing over precisely the same
country as that about Moflong, with vegetation much the same.&nbsp;
A tall Carduaceous tree with pink flowers was found in the swampy bottoms
of the valleys.&nbsp; About Syung, a seneciois tree foliis angustissimus.&nbsp;
It is about this place that the sides of the ravines become clothed
with forest, and from this northward, Pines increase in abundance.&nbsp;
Anthistiria speculis villosissimis continues here and there; a good
deal of cultivation passed on the road, especially under Syung to the
south, where there is a large valley.&nbsp; The chief cultivation appears
to be Coix, Glycine, and some rice, but the produce seemed very small.&nbsp;
At the foot of Syung on the north side, large tufts of Juncus occur,
and on the first ascent another species of Valeriana foliis radicalibus
reniformi cordatus occurs.&nbsp; Urena lobale was noticed as high as
5,300 feet.&nbsp; Between Syung and Myrung, especially about Nungbree,
Parnassia recurs, with another species of Epilobium, Xyris, Juncus,
the Senecione&oelig;, etc.; a new Impatiens occurs towards Myrung.&nbsp;
Generally speaking, the plants are much the same as those about Moflong;
but several new Composit&aelig; occur.</p>
<p>The road leaves Nungbree to the right, leaving the most interesting
parts of the march behind.&nbsp; Altogether not more than 20 additional
plants occurred in a journey of 6 hours.&nbsp; Many parts are wet and
marshy, and there is an absence of all tree vegetation, until one reaches
Syung.&nbsp; This makes the first part of the way somewhat tedious.&nbsp;
At Syung an El&aelig;agnus occurs; Colquhounia as usual in hedges; Styrax
occurs at foot of the hill the altitude of which is 5,000 feet.</p>
<p>An anemone is common on road sides, especially on this side of Syung;
a new Potentilla occurs; and the only Boragineous plant hitherto seen
by me on these hills, a Cynoglossum closely allied to C. canescens.&nbsp;
The altitude of Syung is 5,594 feet.&nbsp; The temperature being 70&deg;,
and water boiling at 202&deg;.&nbsp; Myrung 6 P.M.&nbsp; Thermometer
65&deg;.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>11th</i>.&mdash;Myrung 7 A.M. temp. 63&deg; Fahr.;
noon 67&deg;; 6 P.M. temp. 65&deg;; 9 temp. P.M. 62&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp;
Weather unsettled, showery, and very cloudy, a very fine view is had
of Bootan and the Himalayas from this place, particularly about 7 A.M.
when the atmosphere is clear, the Durrung peaks being most magnificent.&nbsp;
The vegetation of the hills about here is much the same as about Moflong.&nbsp;
The woods are fine, composed chiefly of oaks; a Magnolia, which is a
very large tree, likewise occurs together with Gordonia, an occasional
Pinus, Myrica integrifolia.&nbsp; The most curious tree is one which
with the true appearance of an El&aelig;agnus, seems to be a Loranthus,
the first arborescent species yet found, although, as one or two other
exceptions occur to parasitism, there is no reason why there should
not be a terrestrial arborescent species, as well as a fruticose one.&nbsp;
The wood to the east of the bungalow, which clothes a deep and steep
ravine, has a very rich flora; a dryish ridge on the other side of its
torrent abounds with Orchide&aelig;, and presents an arborescent Gaultheria.&nbsp;
The ridge in question may be recognised by its large rocks which are
covered with Epiphytes Mosses, etc.&nbsp; In this wood Pothos flammea
is very common, climbing up the trees as well as hanging in festoons.&nbsp;
The marshes which are frequented by a few snipe, present grasses, the
usual Cyperace&aelig;, Xyris, occurs but is not common; Panicum stagninum?
Eriocaulon spe. fluitans? Burmannia Rungioidea floribus carneis magnis,
Senecionides, Ammannia rotundifolia, Sphagnum, Carduacea floribus roseis,
Limnophil&aelig; sp. Mentha verticillata, and the others previously
found in similar situations.&nbsp; <i>Goldfussia</i> so common about
Churra, recurs here, but rarely.</p>
<p>The wood abounds with several species of birds, among which a green
<i>Bulbul</i> is the most common, then the fan-tailed Parus, with its
coquettish airs; judging from the voice there is a species of Bucco.&nbsp;
Both species of Ph&aelig;nicornis, yellow and crimson, described in
Gould&rsquo;s Century as male and female, and the black Edolius are
found.&nbsp; The only animals are two species of squirrel, and a genet,
of which I shot one, but although it fell from a height of 70 feet or
so, I could not succeed in securing it; it is a lengthy animal, black
and grey, with a long tail, climbing trees with great facility.&nbsp;
The ring-dove of Churra continues.</p>
<p>The weather during the four days I stayed at Myrung was unsettled;
fine usually in the morning, but cloudy and showery in the evening;
the range of the thermometer from 53&deg;, at 6&frac12; A.M. to 68&deg;
in the afternoon in an open verandah.&nbsp; The place, however, is not
a cheerful one, for the aspect on every side except to the E. and NE.
is dreary, marshes and the usual bleak grassy hills being alone visible.&nbsp;
My favourite spot in this direction would be the Nungbree hill, the
altitude of which, at least of that part over which the road to the
village runs, is 5,439, (or probably 5,700,) temperature of the air
being **, and water boiling at 202&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp; There is a beautiful
and very extensive wood at Nungbree, the largest I have yet seen; it
consists, at least at the skirts, principally of oaks; a large Pyrus
is also not uncommon.&nbsp; Eurya, and an arborescent Buddleia likewise
occur.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p167.jpg">
<img alt="THE OK-KLONG ROCK" src="images/p167.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At this place Plectranthus azureus makes its appearance, otherwise
the vegetation is that of Myrung; the most remarkable plant is a huge
Sarcocordalis, parasitic on the roots of a large climbing Cissus cortice
suberosa, foliis quinatis, on the wet parts of the wood, especially
towards the mountain foot, mosses abound, chiefly the pendent Hypna
and Necker&aelig;.</p>
<p>On the 13th, I went to a celebrated rock called Kullung, bearing
about NW. from Myrung, from the heights surrounding which it is visible;
the road runs off from the Nunklow nearly opposite Monei, near to which
village one passes; the village is of no great size, and as well as
others in this direction is inhabited chiefly by blacksmiths, the iron
being procured from the sand washed down the mountain torrents; the
sound of their anvils when beaten is very soft and musical, not unlike
that of a sheep bell.&nbsp; The road to the rock is very circuitous;
it finally ceases, and for an hour one traverses ridges on which no
path exists, having the usual vegetation.&nbsp; The rock is certainly
a vast mass, forming a precipice of 700 feet to the westward, on which
side it is nearly bare of vegetation, gradually shelving to the east,
and covered with tree-jungle, among which huge mosses are to be found.&nbsp;
At its foot some fine fir trees occur, one at its very base measured
nine feet in circumference, but had no great height.&nbsp; The forest
consists of Oaks, Pines, Panax, Erythrina Eurya, Gordonia.</p>
<p>The base of the rock is covered with mosses, Hepatic&aelig;, a Didymocarpus,
C&aelig;logyne and some other epiphylical orchide&aelig;, among others
Bolbophyllum cylindraceum.</p>
<p>All these continue to its apex, except the mosses and Hepatic&aelig;,
which are gained by clambering, and proceeding up fissures clothed with
grasses.&nbsp; The apex is rounded, presenting here and there patches
of grass, Aira, and Nardus, together with a few stunted shrubs&mdash;Viburnum,
another Rhododendron, and Didymocarpus common, C&aelig;logyne in profusion,
Bolbophyllum cylindraceum in abundance, mosses, Lichens, an Allium also
in abundance on the slopes, Stellaria in the woods towards the middle.</p>
<p>The view to the westward in particular was pretty, embracing a fine
well-wooded undulated valley, with several villages and a stream of
some size.&nbsp; The plains of Assam and the huge Brahmapoutra were
likewise seen, but not very clearly.&nbsp; The distance from Myrung
to the Kullung rock is certainly not less than eight miles, the time
it took was 4 hours.&nbsp; The altitude of the rock is 5,392 feet, temperature
76&deg;, water boiling at 202&frac12;.&nbsp; Wild hog are found round
its base. <a name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168">{168}</a></p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;I left for Moleem, the march is
long and fatiguing; the road leaves the Moflong road at about four miles
from the village of that name, continuing over similar barren hills,
clothed with scanty grass.&nbsp; On reaching Morung firs become common,
but they are small.&nbsp; The view of Moleem, from this direction is
remarkably pretty; the country being better wooded, especially with
young firs, and the effect being much increased by the quantities of
large boulders that occur strewn in every direction.&nbsp; The Boga
Panee is here a contemptible stream, not knee deep.&nbsp; Moleem is
a place of some size on the left bank of the river, occupying the side
of a hill of considerable height.&nbsp; Thermometer 7 P.M. 58&deg;.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>15th</i>.&mdash;Temp. 7 A.M. 53&deg;, at 3 P.M.
70&frac12;&deg;, water boiled at 204&deg;, altitude 4,473 feet, or perhaps
rather more.&nbsp; Walked towards Nogandree; between this and a stream
resembling the Boga Panee there is a pretty valley, the eminences generally
well-wooded with young firs.&nbsp; Pretty and eligible sheltered sites
might here be chosen for a Sanatarium.&nbsp; The vegetation is the same
as that of Moflong&mdash;Delphinium, Ranunculus, Anemone, Potentilla,
Tricyrtis, Codonopsis, Lilium giganteum, Spir&aelig;ace&aelig;, Viola,
Pyrus, Galium, Carduus, Viburna.</p>
<p>The woods are not very frequent, they consist, when not exclusively
of Pines, chiefly of Oaks and Chesnuts.&nbsp; Underwood almost entirely
of Acanthace&aelig;.&nbsp; Rhus Bucki-Amelam is common here, an Oxalis
occurs in very shady places with fleshy leaves, it is so large that
it is scarcely referrible to O. corniculata.&nbsp; Berberis asiatica
is very common.&nbsp; 6 P.M. thermometer 58&deg;, 9 P.M. 50&frac12;&deg;.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>16th</i>.&mdash;7 A.M. 842&frac12;&deg;(sic).&nbsp;
Ascended the Chillong hill, which is among the highest portion of this
range, it is said that from this both the plains of Bengal and of Assam
may be seen, not because it overtops all the intermediate ground, but
because that happens in some places to be rather low; the termination
of the 1st elevation above Churra, is seen to be very abrupt, but nothing
can be seen beyond the elevated plateau of this part towards the south.&nbsp;
To the east and west the view has the usual appearance&mdash;grassy
valleys and hills&mdash;with a great disproportion of jungle.</p>
<p>The summit is gained after an easy march of two hours; the ascent
is gradual.&nbsp; The highest ridge is naked of trees, but to the north
the slope is in one portion covered with heavy tree-jungle, in which
the underwood is as thick as I have ever seen it: it consists of an
Acanthaceous plant; the forest itself of oaks, chesnuts and Rhododendron
arboreum, which last is common on the highest margin.&nbsp; A few Pines
occur, but scarcely above the middle of the hill.&nbsp; To the north
very high ground is visible, as likewise from Myrung, and between this
and Chillong is an elevated plateau which appears to me likewise very
eligible for the sites of European residences.</p>
<p>But many places about Moleem are so, especially towards Nonkreem;
and it is much to be regretted that some situation in this part of the
range had not been selected for the site of a sanatarium instead of
Churra.&nbsp; The Rhododendra were covered with mosses and other epiphytes,
among which Otochilus occurred.&nbsp; Bambus&aelig;, 2 Fici sp. Andropogon,
Gaylussacia, etc. occur about the wood.&nbsp; The vegetation of the
grassy hills was precisely the same, Aroidea, Erianthus, Tofieldioidea,
Parnassia nana <i>potius</i> <i>collina</i>, Sphacelioidea, Osbeckia,
Arbutoide&aelig;, etc.&nbsp; I got scarcely a single new plant; the
best was a fine large Neckera, sect. Dendroidea.&nbsp; The temperature
being 70&deg;: water boiled at 201&deg;, making the altitude 6,167 feet.&nbsp;
No view of any particular beauty was obtained, nor did any thing occur
to repay me for the trouble and fatigue of the journey.</p>
<p>About Moleem an Osmundoid is common enough, but not in <i>flower</i>:
the northern forms are Ranunculus, Anemone, Parnassia, Pyrus, Pinus,
Viola, Galium, Campanula, Clematis, of which an additional species occurs,
Bromoide&aelig;, etc. etc., as at Moflong.&nbsp; I took the height of
this place again; the mean of the three thermometers gave 4,502 feet,
the temperature being at 60&deg;: water boiling at 95&deg;, 203&frac34;&deg;,
204&deg;.&nbsp; It must, however, be remembered that my residence is
not 100 feet above the bed of the Boga Panee, so that it would be easy
to attain an elevation of 5,000 feet in the village itself.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;I returned to Churra to send away
my collections and to consult with Major Lister as to the routes proposed
for me by Capt. Jenkins, viz. through the Garrows, or through the Cacharees.&nbsp;
Nothing particular occurred en route.&nbsp; I met with Hydrangea exaltata
along a torrent flowing into the main-feeder of the Boga Panee, and
two other Araliace&aelig;.&nbsp; The highest ground crossed is towards
the ravine of the Boga Panee, and from this a good view of Moflong is
obtained, and also of the Himalayas in clear weather.&nbsp; C&oelig;logyne
Wallichiana was commencing to flower; this plant occurs in profusion
in some rocky spots about Moflong.&nbsp; The only additional thing I
remarked was, that Luculia scarcely reaches the Kala Panee.</p>
<p>On my return to Churra, a change was observed in the character of
the vegetation, all the Tradescantias had ceased, as well as most of
the Impatientes, and Eriocaulons.&nbsp; The grasses had become more
withered, and the general tint was brown.&nbsp; No kites (Falco milvus)
are to be observed out of Churra.</p>
<p>The plants which were particularly conspicuous about Churra, were
past flowering in the interior; thus Osbeckia Nepalensis? was not to
be met with in flower in the interior, while it is in profusion about
the station.&nbsp; The same may be said of other instances.</p>
<p>After all Churra presents the richest flora of any other place in
the Khasyah hills, because there is a greater extent of wood near it,
than is found in any other locality, much greater <i>altitudes</i> and
deeper descents in its ravines, and it is as it were the transit point
between a tropical or sub-tropical, and a temperate vegetation.&nbsp;
I have no doubt, that within a circle of three miles of Churra, 3,000
species might be found in one year.</p>
<p>The principal plants pointing out the tropical nature of the vegetation
are Pandanus, which is almost limited to the limestone formation, on
which it is excessively abundant, Cham&aelig;rops Martiana? which from
its affecting particularly the walls of the amphitheatres so conspicuous
about Moosmai, Mamloo and Surureem, and the depths of whose sides is
probably at Mamloo 1,000 feet, might have been better named.&nbsp; I
have never seen it on any other places.&nbsp; The Alsophila Brunoniana
is likewise apparently confined to the limestone hills, while the tree
fern, Polypodium, is found on sandstone, as well as Impatiens, Tradescantia,
Commeline&aelig;, Eriocaulone&aelig;, Xyres, almost all the grasses,
Melastomace&aelig;, almost all the Leguminos&aelig; and the preponderance
of tropical Rubiace&aelig;, which are, however, few, Scitamine&aelig;,
Epiphytical Orchide&aelig;, Urena Labiata, etc. etc.</p>
<p>On the <i>23rd</i> I went to Mamloo, which is about four miles to
the west of Churra.&nbsp; To this place the limestone ridge, extending
from Churra, nearly approaches: its vegetation is not rich but always
stunted: rocky amphitheatres are very remarkable at Mamloo, they are
of excessive depth; their walls being generally perpendicular, often
somewhat overhanging.&nbsp; The manner of their formation is now to
be seen in the amphitheatre immediately contiguous to the village, although
it appears to be very slow.&nbsp; It is thus, bodies of water falling
from the edge of the table land, seem to undermine the sandstone below,
producing land slips, which occur in this manner year after year.&nbsp;
Since 1835, the edge of the Moosmai fall has receded at least 10 feet,
and ample evidence remains of the recession to take place next rains.&nbsp;
This simple undermining will suffice for the formation of ravines, which
are formed by their sides merely slipping down without being carried
away, this last only occurring in the immediate vicinity of the strength
of the torrent.&nbsp; All the different stages may be easily seen.&nbsp;
The edge of the table land I take to have been originally at Mahadeb.&nbsp;
The time that has elapsed between the falling of the first cataract
over its edge, and the formation of the edge over which the waters at
present fall, must be immense, since that edge has now receded several
miles.&nbsp; Allowing the annual recess to be 5 feet, and the distance
5 miles; the time occupied would be 5,700 years: that the time has been
great, is proved by the sides of these places being clothed with large
tree-jungle to the base of the scarp.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>25th</i>.&mdash;I went in search of the fossil
marine beach, (found during our first visit in 1835,) but passed it,
and my journey ended at the site of the Jasper beds: this occupies a
ridge where roads strike off leading to the Orange villages, so called
from the groves of orange trees by which they are surrounded, and from
which they derive their name.&nbsp; From this spot, 3 villages are seen
occupying sheltered situations, none much above 2,000 feet in elevation.&nbsp;
Luckily I was accompanied, (although going down I was unconscious of
it,) by a boy who had been with McClelland when he originally discovered
the fossil remains, so I recommenced the ascent, after digging in many
places without any success.&nbsp; The site is scarcely 1,000 feet below
Mamloo, which is 3,153 feet; it is below the ridge along which the road
is visible from the village, and is about 100 yards farther from it
than the second square stone erection.&nbsp; One would imagine that
one was passing through rocks presenting nothing interesting: the rocks
are in many places very hard, particularly when they have been long
exposed to the atmosphere, in which case they are less red than when
sheltered by vegetation, when they are soft and of a reddish colour:
the fossils are by no means frequent, the cylindric <i>tubes</i> appear
to occupy the outer or rather upper surface of the sandstone, in the
interior of which Medus&aelig; or Cyrtom&aelig; are most frequent, accompanied
by shells, some of large size, the largest bivalves resembling <i>scolloped</i>
<i>oysters</i>; the next in size looking like oblong cockles: for only
in one position did I see a conglomeration of minute shells; this occurred
above the others and nearer the jungle.&nbsp; I brought away with me,
two boxes full.&nbsp; Owing to my presuming that I should meet with
water near, I omitted the precaution of taking some with me, so I could
not ascertain exactly the height of the place.&nbsp; All the fossils
are easily friable. <a name="citation172"></a><a href="#footnote172">{172}</a></p>
<p>From the Jasper, which is scarce 1,800 feet in elevation, the following
plants occurred nearly in succession&mdash;Holmskioldia, this is scarcely
found above 2,000 feet; Porana in abundance, gradually diminishing above;
Callicarpa arborea abundant, continuing to about 2,200; Triumfetta,
Urena lobata, Arundo the same as above, Melica latifolia, Panicum plicatum,
and one or two other species; a Polygonum, Andropogon, small Commeline,
Leea, Erythrina are very close to the spot, and the only Churra plant,
except the Arundo and Wendlandia is a Labiata, Geniosporum? so is Composita
arborea; indeed the vegetation is almost decidedly tropical.&nbsp; The
following plants are then seen&mdash;Tetranthera, Flemingia as at Mahadeb,
Vitis, Drymaria, Panicum eleusinoides, Eurya, Panax foliis decompositis
inermis, Pogonatherum crenitum, Wallichia, which occur before one has
gained an ascent of 2,000 feet: Osbeckia nepalensis descends to this
but in small quantities; then I remarked Bidens, &AElig;theilema, Caricine&aelig;,
Rottlera, Didymocarpus, Begonia, Cheilanthes dealbata, Stemodia ruderalis?
Scutellaria, Impatiens bracteata, Rungi&aelig; sp. Sida, Elephantopus
sp. and Bambusa, Gordonii occurring there at an elevation of about 2,100
feet.&nbsp; Then Centotheca lappacea, Deeringia, Panicum <i>centrum</i>,
Gouania, Caryophyllus, which last occurs on all the chain of Himalayas,
and which I have seen as high as 6,000 feet in the Mishmee Mountains,
latitude 28&deg;.&nbsp; Panax foliis palmatim partitis, Clerodendrum
nutans, Ficus feruginea and F. hispida, foliis cordatis, serrato-dentatis:
then Saurauja micrantha; before 2,300 feet were reached.&nbsp; There
Oxyspora sp. paniculis cernius ramis ascendentibus, frutex, Croton of
old, Ruellia persic&aelig;folia appeared, and about 2,400 feet, the
1st Quercus appeared.&nbsp; Here, as at Mahadeb, Ruellia Neesiana became
common, and Linum trigynum, Uncinia, etc.&nbsp; Grasses commence to
preponderate at about 2,800 feet, but not the grasses of Churra.&nbsp;
Holcus, Airoides, etc. not being found, but Panica varia, and Rottboellia
which ceases above this.</p>
<p>At the raised Marine Fossil Beach, a queer Cephalanthus? Legumenosa
arbuscula fol. pinnatis impari (Pongami&aelig;) Legumenibus secus suturam
quamque alatis, Mangifera indici, Anthistiria arundinacea are found,
and an arbusculous Mimosa, but unarmed.&nbsp; Shortly above this, Holcus,
Andropogons, etc., begin to preponderate, and thence the vegetation
is nearly that of Churra.&nbsp; The woods of Mamloo consist of Bucklandia,
oaks, chesnuts, Panax, Hyalostemma, Eurya, and Oleine&oelig;; Epiphytes
are very common.&nbsp; The most remarkable tree is one foliis alternis
bistipulat; corymbis denis, Calycibus hinc fissis, petalis 5-albis,
Anther&aelig; sinuos&aelig; columna terminans, et ovarium et stigma
occultantes? fructibus pendulis stipilatis ovato oblongis, carpellis
5-latere marginatus.</p>
<p>This has some affinities apparently with Sterculiace&aelig;; the
flowers are perhaps polygamous.</p>
<p>Here Cypripedium insigne, Venustum, and various other fine Orchide&aelig;
may be found.</p>
<p>The only bird I saw was a Bucco, which in voice resembled the green
one of the plains.</p>
<p>The elevation of Mamloo is 3,153, the temperature being at 7 A.M.
63&deg;.&nbsp; The large metal thermometer rose at the boiling point
to 206&frac14;&deg;: wooden one to 206&frac12;&deg;: centigrade 96.7&deg;:
small metal 200&deg;.</p>
<p>One of the most curious places about Churra is situated over the
ridge in which the coal is found; on surmounting this, which is steep
and perhaps 400 feet high, one soon commences to descend gradually until
you come to a water-course; on proceeding along this a short way you
come to a precipice.&nbsp; The water falling over this, has cut a deep
well in the limestone: the road to the bottom is precipitous and dangerous.&nbsp;
On reaching the water-course again no signs of the well are observable,
access to this is gained by subterranean passages, of which two, now
dry, exist.&nbsp; The scene inside is very striking; you stand on the
rugged bottom of the well which is 70 or 80 feet deep, the part above
corresponding to the fall, being of about the same depth; the water
now escapes through a chasm below the bed of the well, the other fissures
or passages being above, and probably now rarely letting off the water.&nbsp;
After a severe fall of rain the scene must be grand.</p>
<p><i>November</i> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Nonkreem 6&frac12; A.M., thermometer
31&deg;: hoarfrost.&nbsp; Marched hither from Surureem.&nbsp; Vegetation
the same until you reach the Boga Panee, when Delphinium, Anemone, and
Ranunculus make their appearance.&nbsp; On the high ridges before reaching
Boga Panee, found an Astragalus; at Nonkreem, a Scrophularia.&nbsp;
Nonkreem is a curious place, the village of no great size in a valley:
the sides of the valley are covered with boulders; those at the entrance
from Churra of huge size, and thrown together with great confusion.&nbsp;
Pines at this place occur of some size, but they are distinctly limited
in this direction to the granitic formation.&nbsp; The downs have now
assumed a withered wintry appearance.&nbsp; Nonkreem is a great place
for iron; this is found in coarse red sandstone, or it may be fine granite,
forming precipices; this is scraped or pushed down by iron rods, it
is then washed by a stream turned off on to it: the stream is dammed
up, and the irony particles by their weight fall to the bottom: they
are very heavy, of a dull blackish appearance.&nbsp; All the streams
are of a whitish colour, and the rocks are covered with C&aelig;logyne
Wallichiana.</p>
<p>The elevation of Nonkreem is 4,578 feet, the temperature of the air
being 52&deg;.&nbsp; The large thermometer indicated boiling water 203&deg;:
centigrade 96&frac12;&deg;: wooden 204&deg;: small 197&deg;.&nbsp; In
the Nonkreem jheel, Alisma, Villarsia! and Potamogeton occur.</p>
<p><i>November</i> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;The march to Suneassa continues
over high downs, the vegetation being precisely as before, viz. Cnicus,
Carduus, Prunella Pedicularis, Gaultheria, Gnaphalia, Bromoid acroideum,
Tussilaginoid Andropogon, Sphacelia Daucas, Hypericum, Hedychium, Polygonum
rheoides, Smithia but rare, Tradescantia clavigera, Parnassia collina,
Pteris aquilina, Euphorbia, Dipsacus, Salix, Osbeckia capitata, &AElig;thionnia,
Eriocaulon, Knoxia cordata, and Campanula.&nbsp; In short, the higher
ridges have the vegetation of those between the Kala and Boga Panee,
the less elevated, that of Surureem.&nbsp; Along the watercourses Pyrus,
Betula, Corylifoli&aelig;, and Eurya.</p>
<p>As one approaches Suneassa the ravines become wooded, and the aspect
of country more diversified.&nbsp; The woods consist of a Castanea,
2 oaks, Rhododendron arboreum and R. punctatum, Panax, Eurya, Thebaudiace&aelig;
vari&aelig;, no less than 4 or 5 of these, one is a Gaylussacia; Saccharum
megala makes its appearance at Suneassa.</p>
<p>This is a small straggling village, on the brow of the ravine of
the same name; it is like Moflong, each house being hidden by hedges
composed as usual of Buddleia, Colquhounii, Solanum spirale? Erythrina,
Ficus, and Rhus.&nbsp; Sugarcane, but of poor quality, is here cultivated,
as well as capsicum, but this is also of inferior quality; the houses
are worse than usual.&nbsp; Near this place several Nunklow plants appear,
as Plectranthus c&aelig;ruleus, Labiata foliis verticillatis of Suddya.&nbsp;
Its elevation is 4,362 feet, the temperature being in the air, 59&deg;.&nbsp;
Big thermometer boiling point ditto 204&deg;: wooden ditto 204&deg;:
small 198&deg;: centigrade ditto 96&deg;.&nbsp; Pines occur here and
there towards Suneassa, but of no size and no abundance.</p>
<p><i>November</i> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;Left Suneassa and proceeded down
the ravine which is probably 1,200 to 1,500 feet deep.&nbsp; The scenery
is very pretty, the sides being much wooded; the woods open, consisting
chiefly of pines, which are of moderate size, Gordonia, Castanea, and
Quercus: Mimosea occurs, also Saurauja.&nbsp; The grasses are as before,
except that the Anthisteria of Nunklow appears, with Volkameria, Verbena
Primulac&aelig;, and Osbeckia capitate, foliis lineari oblongis, floribus
carneis.&nbsp; Towards the foot, the scenery still improves.</p>
<p>The woods consist of pines and a Quercus foliis castane&aelig; cupulis
echinatis, Arbor mediocris; the slopes as well as the valley are cultivated
chiefly for rice, this last often assuming the terrace fashion.&nbsp;
The river is of considerable width, 50 to 60 yards, but of no depth:
two here flow together, and at the end of the valley a still larger
stream not fordable in the rains, at least where I crossed, meets it.&nbsp;
On the streams at the base of the Suneassa acclivity, Salix, Ligustrum,
Ficus frutex humelis, and a fine Indigofera occur.&nbsp; Moving thence
along the valley the vegetation becomes tropical, although pines descend
nearly to its level.&nbsp; Pontederia the small one of Bengal, ditto
Sagittaria Vandelli&aelig;, Po&aelig; 3, Apluda, Cyperace&aelig;, Saccharum
megala, and spontaneum, Elytrophorus, Ammannia, Erianthus, Cnicus! Artemisia
as before, Arundo exalum, Cirsium, Carduus! Scitamine&aelig; 2, Panicum
curvatum, Setaria glauca, Swertia angustifolia! Volkameri&aelig; sp.,
Ranunculus hirsutoideus! Zizania ciliaris.</p>
<p>Those marked with (!) have probably straggled down.&nbsp; The cultivation
is chiefly of rice, Eleusine, Coix, and the edible seeded Labiata.&nbsp;
Grasses abound; in addition to those above several new ones occur, Rottboellia
exallata, Anthisteria of Nunklow, Arundinace&aelig;, Andropogones several,
Saccharum fusco-rubum, 25 species might certainly be collected.</p>
<p>Fine pines occur on the other ascent from its base to apex.&nbsp;
Here also occurs Ph&oelig;nix pumile, which as well as the Rottboellia,
which I think I have seen in the Mogoung valley (during the journey
to Ava), and Buddleia neemda.</p>
<p>The ascent gained, the country appears level, covered with the usual
grasses.&nbsp; The ravines are well wooded, but few pines occur, although
they may be seen here and there.&nbsp; The woods appear the same as
those of Churra.&nbsp; Pandanus sp. altera? occurs.&nbsp; In one ravine
gathered a new Thebaudiace&aelig; allied to T. variegata, differing
in its short greenish flowers and its smoothness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/g176.jpg">
<img alt="Gradient Nonkreem to Amwee" src="images/g176.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Amwee is situated on an undulated plain or table land; the undulations
are gentle, separated by marshy tracts: no steep ravines occur, the
face of the undulations is covered with grasses, among which are seen
most of the Churra plants, the sides are covered with fine woods with
defined edges, consisting chiefly of oaks, chesnuts and Bucklandia.&nbsp;
The aspect of the country is pretty, resembling some woodland scenery
in the south of England; close to Amwee is a fine stream 40 yards wide,
this winds through the valley, and on its upper part fine cascades occur.&nbsp;
No fish are to be found besides those of Churra.&nbsp; The river is
crossed by a stone bridge consisting of pillars of single slabs of large
size, one measuring 20 feet in length by from 4 to 5 in breadth.&nbsp;
The temperature varies from 50 to 68 during the day in an open verandah.&nbsp;
Fogs are not so common, nor is the rain so heavy as at Churra.&nbsp;
The space being much greater, and the country more level, it would be
better as a sanatarium than Churra, besides which, its access is as
easy, it being reached in one day from Jynteapore.&nbsp; There is, however,
a Toorai about Jynteapore, which is unhealthy.&nbsp; Its altitude is
3,500 feet, or nearly 500 below Churra.</p>
<p>The vegetation is nearly the same as about Churra, some new Castane&aelig;
and an El&aelig;ocarpus occur, and Pandanus of large size in the woods.&nbsp;
Epiphytical Orchide&aelig; abound; Nepenthes occurs here.&nbsp; Altitude
from three observations 3,530 feet: 1st observation 3,439: 2nd 3,597:
3rd 3,624.</p>
<p><i>November</i> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;Joowye: this is north from Amwee,
and about 8 miles distant.&nbsp; Two valleys have to be descended, one
rather steep.&nbsp; The country alters immediately after the 1st ascent,
the woods nearly disappearing except in the more favoured spots.&nbsp;
Pines soon commence.&nbsp; In the second valley, the stream of which
is large, and of which pretty views are to be obtained, the pines reach
on the south side to the bank of the stream, on the north scarcely any
are to be seen.&nbsp; In the woods about Amwee, Eugenia is very common:
noticed on the route Lonicera.</p>
<p>Joowye is the largest village I have seen, it is of great extent
but straggling; near its entrance is a breast-work now nearly complete.&nbsp;
The houses are of a better description than those generally met with.&nbsp;
They are surrounded by wood, especially fine bamboos, in habit not unlike
B. baccifera.&nbsp; They are also surrounded by excellent timber palings.&nbsp;
The people are different from Khasyas Proper&mdash;perhaps they are
not so fine a race.&nbsp; Their features approach more to those of Bengallees,
particularly the women, who dress their hair like those of Assam, indeed
the dress generally of both sexes assimilates to that of Assamese, although
their language seems to be Bengallee.&nbsp; In the wood surrounding
this place curious features of vegetation occur, and beautiful lanes
and pathways.&nbsp; One may see a beech now naked of leaves, standing
out in graceful relief close to the elegant foliage of a bamboo.&nbsp;
Bamboos surround all the houses&mdash;sugarcane, kuchoos, mustard, hemp,
Musa, Ricinus were observed.</p>
<p>The plants are beech, which is common and of large size.&nbsp; Pyrus
of Moleem, Pinus rare, Marlea begonifolia! Betula corylifolia common.&nbsp;
Verbena cham&aelig;drys, Rubi 3 or 4, Tetranther&aelig;? Rubia cordifolia,
Morus, Cerasus, Panax 3 species, Gleicheni&aelig; 2, Eurya, Juncus,
Ranunculus, Viola, Verbesina of Moflong, Sida, Clematis <i>pubescens</i>,
Caricine&aelig;, Myrica, Gordonia, Polygonum 3, among them Rheoides
Engeldhaardtii common, Viburna 2, Wendlandia, Osbeckia capitata and
nepalensis.&nbsp; The grasses chiefly Andropogons; Muss&aelig;nda, Bucklandia,
Saurauja, Hir&aelig;a, Dipsacus rare, Camellia oleifolia, and C. axillaris,
Begonia laciniata, Ficus, Vitis, Sonerila, Plectranthus azureus, Randia,
Mephitidia, Psychotria, Galium, Clerodendrum infortunatum, Pyrus or
crab, Fragaria, Potentilla, Urena lobata.&nbsp; The diversified nature
of the vegetation, both tropical and temperate, is at once evident.</p>
<p>The altitude is 3,553 feet&mdash;temperature of the air 62&deg;;
large thermometer boiling point 205&frac12;&deg;: wooden ditto 206&frac34;:
centigrade ditto 96&deg;: small ditto 199&frac12;&deg;.</p>
<p>The higher ground about the place is about 4,000 feet: Joowye being
situated in a hollow.&nbsp; Viola and Peristrophe occur.</p>
<p><i>November</i> <i>11th</i>.&mdash;The march to Nurtung occupies
about 6 hours.&nbsp; The country is level, or merely undulated, with
no considerable descent, the steepest being that to the river on which
Nurtung is situated.&nbsp; The vegetation continues the same, the trees
except in the ravines almost exclusively pines, those on the ravines
consisting of oaks, Rhododendra, Betula corylifolia, Betula moroides,
Solidago, Verbena, Primulace&aelig;, Othonna, occur; Anthistiri&aelig;,
<i>both</i> those of Nunklow are common, Rottboellia Manisuris in low
valleys: here and there Ph&oelig;nix pumila is common.&nbsp; The country
just before Nurtung is uninteresting, scarcely any thing but grass being
visible in some directions.&nbsp; Indeed it falls off on leaving Joowye.</p>
<p>Rhinanthus, Corolla infundibulif. subbilabiat. lobis 2, superioribus

<p><i>November</i> <i>12th</i>.&mdash;Nurtung is a large place for these
hills, perhaps next in extent to Joowye, it occupies principally both
sides of a sufficiently sheltered hill.&nbsp; The lanes adjacent to
the place are narrow, often very wet, and always very dirty.&nbsp; The
gardens are enclosed with wooden palings and are screened still further
by bamboos.&nbsp; The houses, at least the better order, are still better
than even those of Joowye.&nbsp; The exterior is of the same construction
as all Khasya houses, but the lawns and the comparative cleanliness
of the front makes them look much better.&nbsp; The market, which took
place to-day, is outside the village and close to our bungalow: it is
well attended, but the amount of persons could not exceed 100 to 200,
and these form a considerable amount of all the persons capable of bearing
burdens from the neighbouring villages.&nbsp; The luxuries exhibited
are all Khasyan, consisting of stinking fish, some other things of dubious
appearance and still more dubious odour, millet and the inferior grains,
and the fashionable articles of Khasya clothing and the adjuncts to
that abominable habit pawn eating.&nbsp; There was plenty of noise,
but still order prevailed: no other rupees than the <i>rajah&rsquo;s</i>
were taken, and even pice were refused.&nbsp; Iron implements of husbandry
of native manufacture were vended, in short all the various luxuries
or necessaries of a Khasya are obtainable.</p>
<p>This place bears evidence of having been ruled over by some chief
pretending to Hindooism.&nbsp; This is observable in the large fig trees
in some of the buildings, in most of the houses in the presence of some
brahmins, in the tanks, and in a sacred lake.&nbsp; At any rate it is
attended with bad effects, and to see a Khasya attempting the formalities
of a rigid Hindoo is ridiculously absurd.</p>
<p>It must be a wealthy place, many of the natives are well off; and
I saw a <i>lady</i> of a decidedly superior nature to the Khasya women,
clad in snow white, reclining in oriental fashion on a platform.&nbsp;
The <i>vegetation</i> of this place forms a curious melange around our
huts: Rhus bucki ameli, two Artimise&aelig;, Anthistiria arundinacia,
Pteris aquilina, Callicarpa <i>lilacina</i>, Eurya, Bombax, Osbeckia
nepalensis and linearis, Marlea begonifolia, Pyrus, Pinus, Urticia fructibus
aurantiaceus capitulatis, Polygonum rheoides, Rubi 3, Swertia angustifolia,
Polygonum globuliferum, Valerian&aelig;, Cacalia, Randia, Gnaphalia
nervosa, and G. revoluta, Smilax, Plectranthus azureus, Trichosanthes,
Leea, Tradescantia clavigera, Geniosporum, <i>Butea</i>, Hypericum,
Knoxia cordata, Rice cultivation.</p>
<p>Along the path to the village are to be found, Carduus, Myrica crotalaria,
<i>Hacyoides</i>, Caricene&aelig;, Panicum curvatum, Arundo, Mentha
verticillata, Cyperaec&aelig; usual, Zizania ciliaris, Panax, Wendlandia
<i>Salvinia</i>, Isachne bigeniculata, Betula corylifolia common, Pontedera,
Tetranthera, Erythrina, Celtis, Salix, Buddleia, Gordonia, Calamus abundant,
Juncus, Arum macrophyllum, Cordiace&aelig;, Urena lobata, Cynoglossum
canescens, Bambusa, Verbesinea, <i>Lavinia</i>, Magnolia of Myrung,
Camellia oleifolia, Gualtheria.</p>
<p>About the village, Porana, Musa, Verbena, Xanthophyllum, Xyris, Urtica
herophylla, Sambucus, etc.</p>
<p>The cultivation consists of rice, millet, Soflong? pumpkins and tobacco;
guavas and oranges, are also to be seen.</p>
<p>Daphne cannabina occurs here, as well as Loxotis obliqua, the Cardaminum,
Plantago, and Martynia.</p>
<p>From a fresh observation and taking the mean, I find the elevation
of Nurtung to be 3,302 feet.</p>
<p>On enquiry I find that Rulung is one march off, that the country
is similar, and that pines grow there to a large size.&nbsp; From this
place to Koppilee river it is said to be nine marches.&nbsp; A fuqueer
from Cutch said several, six to ten&mdash;and as the distance is nearly
fifty miles and the ground difficult, he was probably right.</p>
<p>You then come to the Meekir country.&nbsp; To get into Tooly Ram&rsquo;s
country would require at least nine days, but with loaded people probably
twelve or fifteen.&nbsp; The station between Rulung and the Koppilee
is Hush Koorah.&nbsp; Thermometer varies here from 45 to 85 in the sun,
in shade from 52 to 74.</p>
<p><i>November</i> <i>13th</i>.&mdash;Left for the Borpanee.</p>
<p>The country traversed is easy, consisting chiefly of undulations
covered with grassy vegetation.&nbsp; There are no steep ascents nor
descents; and the only obstacle is the Borpanee.&nbsp; The march is
of about six hours&rsquo; duration.</p>
<p>Butea suffruticosa is very common about Nurtung, but ceases soon
after leaving its environs.&nbsp; All the valleys near this place are
cultivated: the ground being now inundated in proportion.&nbsp; Dipsacus
valeriana continued, and a short distance from Nurtung pines become
very common.&nbsp; Thence the country became more undulated and scarcely
a tree was met with: Hedysarum gyrans commenced shortly after leaving
Nurtung: a sure sign of decreasing elevation.&nbsp; The country subsequently
improved, being more diversified with wood: firs became abundant, Callicarpa
arborea commenced.&nbsp; About Nonkreen, a small village to the east,
close to our path the trees became mostly different.&nbsp; Kydia appeared,
a tree like the mango, and some others unknown to me.&nbsp; Bauhinia,
Randia, Phyllanthus Embelica, and a stunted arboreous Symplocos, Anthistiria
arundinacea common, with chesnuts (Castane&aelig;).</p>
<p>Close to this, Gordonia, pines of some size, Anthistiria arundinacea
and Cassioides.&nbsp; The grasses continued the same, but two new Andropogons
and a small Rottboellia appear; Holcus, Airoides, etc. of Churra have
ceased: the other are Sacchara and various Andropogons.&nbsp; On approaching
a considerable descent the woods became open, consisting at first entirely
of pines, Betula of Joowye, etc. then of pines, Quercus castaneoides
which attains a large size.&nbsp; It was here that the pines became
large, one felled measured sixty-nine feet to the first branch, most
are straight, the greatest diameter not two feet.&nbsp; Gordonia occurred
here of large size, the woods are really delightful, reminding one much
of England.&nbsp; Here Myrica occurs but rarely, Lematula, Flemingia,
Elephantopus, Vanda, Quercus callicarpifolius commences, Biophytum appears
a short distance hence.&nbsp; Also, Liriodendron, Dipterocarpus, Bambusa,
Pinus but of smaller size, Engelhaardtia, Dioscorea, Castanea, Quercus
callicarpa, which is very common.</p>
<p>Here Bombax appears somewhat lower, with it Castanea, Kydia, Gordonia.&nbsp;
No pines now occur except on the neighbouring heights.</p>
<p>The descent to the Borpanee is not great, say 400 feet; on its banks
Thunbergia grandiflora commences, but the Castanea castaneoides of large
size, Camellia oleifolia, Daphne cannabina, Rhododendron punctatum variety.&nbsp;
Engenia Wallichii (which commences), Quercus castaneoides, etc. may
be found along its banks.</p>
<p>This is a large stream, not fordable at any time, nor passable in
the rains; both banks are high, rocks of course break the stream, which
is gentle at the points crossed.&nbsp; Breadth is 50 to 60 yards, the
elevation of its bed is 2,508 feet, water boiling at 207&frac12;&deg;:
temperature 74&deg;.</p>
<p>The ascent of the north bank is great, on surmounting it one returns
to grassy undulations, the vegetation of which is the same as before,
Rottboellia of Suniassa as well as Manisuroides here occur.&nbsp; The
village Madan is very small, the people, of course, as they have scarcely
ever seen a white face, very polite and obliging: it is situated on
a hill, but is still below the north bank of the river.&nbsp; Its altitude
is 2,753 feet&mdash;temperature of the air 67&deg;: boiling water 207&deg;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/g182.jpg">
<img alt="Gradient Nurtung to Madan" src="images/g182.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The birds, as well as those of the Nurtung river, are the water-ouzel,
the greyish-blue water-chat, the red and black ditto with a white head-top,
and the black bird, <i>durn</i>-<i>durns</i> or bird producing that
cry occurs, but not in great numbers.&nbsp; Pea-fowl at Madan.&nbsp;
Elephants are abundant, especially towards the descent to the Borpanee.&nbsp;
<i>Fly</i> <i>wheel</i> (?) insect is here common at Kokreen, a small
village close to Nonkreen.&nbsp; Equisetum occurs along the Boga Panee
as well as a new species of Podostemon, P. fronde profunde lobato, lobis
liniaribus simplicibus vel lobatis saxis arcti adpressis, floribus marginalibus
distiches.&nbsp; Polygala occurs at 3,000 feet and continues higher.</p>
<p><i>November</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;The march to Mengtung occupies
about six hours, it is by no means difficult, and the only ascent of
any length is that before descending on Nungtung.&nbsp; Throughout the
1st part, all the bottoms of the valleys are cultivated, thence all
is jungle, either of high grass or of trees.</p>
<p>Near Madan, Arundinaria bambusifolia may be found, although at an
elevation of 2,800 feet, Volkameria is common.&nbsp; The same grasses
continue.&nbsp; In the rice field Butomus lanceolatus, Herpestes, Juss&aelig;ia,
Juncus, Eriocaulon, Zizana ciliaris.</p>
<p>We then came after traversing such low swampy ground for sometime
to a wood composed of Quercus castaneoidea, of large size; its bark
is thick and somewhat corky, its diameter three feet.&nbsp; Quercus
callicarpifolius appeared soon after, with Polygala linearis, Scitamine&aelig;
are common in the valley.&nbsp; In similar low places, Impatiens graminifolia
of Churra was seen, and Hedysarum gyrans.</p>
<p>Oolooks <a name="citation183"></a><a href="#footnote183">{183}</a>
and parrots are both found: Cnicus floribus roseis, Gerardia, Apluda,
Senecio pubescens, were found in similar spots.</p>
<p>After traversing a low valley with gentle undulations presenting
the usual grasses, we came to a wood presenting many tropical features.&nbsp;
Oaks and chesnuts still continuing to be the usual trees.&nbsp; Much
underwood, consisting of Acanthace&aelig;, Laurine&aelig;, Anonace&aelig;,
Rubiace&aelig;, among which P&oelig;deria triphylla and Mephitidia were
common.&nbsp; Centothca sp., Sarcopyramis, Garcinia, Triumfetta were
observed.</p>
<p>Thence we came to pines.&nbsp; Then a low valley, the altitude of
the stream of which was 1,979 feet, the thermometer being in the air
82&deg;, boiling point 208&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp; Then a wood.</p>
<p>In it Castanea ferruginea continued common, Quercus dalbergioides,
Daphne cannabina, Acanthus leucostachyus (1st appearance), Oxyspora
and Polypodium Wallichii were found; ascending a few feet, say 60, Randia
microphyllum, Aneilema aspera, and pines appeared in the woods, with
straight trunks and high branches, occasioned by the abortion of the
lower branches, sometimes dichotomously forked, bark grey, and scaley,
branches horizontal, approximated; cones inclining towards the axis.&nbsp;
The descent occasioned a loss of pines, oaks and chesnuts continuing,
Orthopogon, Pederia triphyllum.</p>
<p>This wood was of great extent, the path running along the precipitous
or steep edge of a very wet water-course.&nbsp; Castanea ferruginea
very common, Cyrtandracea.</p>
<p>Begonia malabarica, Achyranthes, Tradescantia flagellifera, Phlogacanthus,
Acanthace&aelig;, Sarcopyramis, Magnolia, Eupatorium arboreum, Laurine&aelig;,
Gleichenia minor.</p>
<p>Pinus subsequently appears but is rare, Eurya.</p>
<p>Daphne involucrata, Gaultheria arborescens, Knoxia cordata, Polypodium
arborescens, Thibaudia, Viburni sp., Vareca, Leucas galea brunacea.</p>
<p>Then still gradually ascending, open woods occurred.</p>
<p>Pines, Q. castaneoides.</p>
<p>Thence the ascent is still through open woods of pines.&nbsp; Castanea,
Quercus castaneoides and callicarpifolia, Polygala here appears, Knoxia
linearis, Flemingia, &AElig;schynomene.</p>
<p>On the top no Pines.&nbsp; Oaks, chesnuts, and Gordoni&aelig; appear.</p>
<p>Thence a second but small ascent, pines re-appear with birch, Scutellaria,
Erythrina, Melica latifolia, Epiphytes common, especially on Gordoni&aelig;.&nbsp;
The altitude of the summit before descending on Nungtung was 3,359 feet:
thermometer 75&deg;, boiling point 206&deg;.</p>
<p>The altitude of Nungtung is 2,862 feet, Temp. 64&deg;.&nbsp; Big
Therm. in boiling water 206&frac12;&deg;, ditto wooden 207&deg;, small
ditto 201&deg;, centigrade 97&frac34;&deg;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/g185.jpg">
<img alt="Gradient Madan to Nungtung" src="images/g185.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Nungtung is a small village not containing more than 12 houses; these
are on michaowns, <a name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186">{186}</a>
and are built entirely of bamboos.&nbsp; The doors of curious construction,
consisting of bamboos strung longitudinally over a transverse one, so
that they can be only opened by pushing on one side.&nbsp; The pigs
have similar doors to their houses and appear well acquainted with the
mode of ingress and egress.</p>
<p>Tobacco flourishes here.&nbsp; Here also I saw Sesamum and Ricinus,
sure signs of increasing temperature, Labiata edulis.&nbsp; The first
part of the march lay through an oak and chesnut wood; then through
the valley which is under rice cultivation; then through part of an
oak and fir wood; I then turned off to NNE. traversing undulated hills
entirely covered with grass; here and there an oak and chesnut wood
occurred; this continued until 1 P.M., when the path joined the great
road as it is called, but which is nearly as bad as the Nungtung one.&nbsp;
The marching was very disagreeable, owing to the path being choked up
with grass, particularly in the swampy valley just before Onkreem.&nbsp;
In this valley wild elephants were first seen.</p>
<p>After leaving the halting or resting place under a large oak (Q.
castaneoides) at Onkreem, the path improved and is only rendered bad
by the swarms of elephants, by which animals we were disturbed twice;
it continued until 6 P.M., over undulated ground becoming lower and
lower until we arrived at the large valley of Onswye, which is even
now at this advanced period of the season, the middle of November, considerably
swampy.</p>
<p>Oaks and chesnuts continued, but pines ceased about half way between
Onkreem and Onswye.</p>

<p>Onswye is a small village, seated on a low hill, and entirely hidden
by trees: the access to it is pretty.&nbsp; Its elevation is 1,632 feet,
temperature 63&deg;.&nbsp; Water boils at 98&frac34; of centigrade,
small ther. 202&frac12;&deg;, big ditto 208&frac34;&deg;, wooden ditto
210&deg;: taking 209&deg; as the mean.</p>
<p>It is a Lalung village.&nbsp; These people have distinct habits and
language from their neighbours: their dress is like that of the Khasyahs.&nbsp;
They approach to Hindoos in not eating cows.&nbsp; They inhabit the
lower northern ranges of these hills, but do not extend further east,
nor into the plains at the foot, and are far less civilized than the
Khasyahs.</p>
<p>They have religious houses or places of worship, deo-ghurs, in one
of which I slept, having it first cleansed, and the deity appeased by
some most villainous music, and a procession of men with knives.</p>
<p>At this village Carica, Ficus elastica, Ficus cordifolius, Ricinus,
Artocarpus intigrifol, Tamarind, Guava, Musa, Solanum Melongena, tobacco,
etc., are cultivated.</p>
<p>Caryophyllea scandens, Desmoch&aelig;ta, Plumbago, Plectranthus azureus,
Phlebochiton, Cassia tora, Orthopogon, Adhatoda, Mangifera, Croton malv&aelig;fol,
Hastingsia, Torenia asiatica, Caricinea, Leea, Prunus! Congea! Antidesma,
Rottleria, Clerodendron nutans, Calamus, Xanthochymus.&nbsp; Mesua ferrea,
Garcinia Cowa, Leea arbuscula, Dalhousia, Roxburghia, are found on the
ascent which is moderate and pretty.</p>
<p>The heavy tree or bamboo jungle does not begin until you attain 12
or 1,500 feet, up to that, the ridges present the former grasses.&nbsp;
Rottboellia, Andropogons, Erianthus, Saccharum, Anthistiria, and the
trees are scattered consisting of Arborescent Leguminos&aelig;, Sterculia,
Cedrela, Semicarpus continues to the tree jungle, but rarely.</p>
<p>The road to the village runs through heavy woods, the plants forming
which I have already mentioned, it is in good order.&nbsp; The village
is a Lalung one.</p>
<p>At Dullagong, which is situated in the plains of Assam, at the foot
of the range the temperature being 66&deg;, 8&frac12; A.M., water boiled
at 211.1&deg; in the large thermometer.&nbsp; 100 centigrade, and above
the boiling point in the wooden.&nbsp; 205&frac12;&deg; in the small
metal thermometer.</p>
<p>Between this and Goba, the path is generally through grass or tree
jungle.&nbsp; I noticed Exacum, Careya, Butea arborea, Ficus, Cinchona,
Kydia, Saccharum Megala fuscum masus, Spathodea, Alstonia, Bombax, Semicarpus!
&AElig;gle Marmelos, Emblica, Panax, Elephantopus, and Lagerstr&aelig;mia
Regin&aelig; succeeds about Goba: and between this and Dhumria, the
country being low and highly cultivated, presents generally the appearance
of one sheet of rice.&nbsp; In this march I observed one or two instances
of the absolute enclosure of Dicotyledonous trunks by Fici.&nbsp; This
enclosure arises entirely from the excessive tendency to cohesion between
the roots and radicles of some of the species of this genus.&nbsp; With
these, an expert gardener might produce any form he likes; the tendency
exists in all to throwing out additional roots; in few only to excess.&nbsp;
In the generality it is limited to the trunk and often to its base.&nbsp;
Nobody can understand this genus who cannot study it from living specimens.</p>
<p>Cardiopterus is very common along the foot of these hills: it abounds
with milky juice, and in habit and some other points approaches nearer
to Chenopodiace&aelig; than Sapindace&aelig;.</p>
<p><i>December</i> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;Returned from Jeypore, whither
I had been to report on the Caoutchouc trees. <a name="citation193"></a><a href="#footnote193">{193}</a></p>
<p>These trees appear to be limited to the belt of jungle or toorai
which commences towards the foot of the Aka and Duphla hills, and which
in the part in which I examined them is about 8 miles wide.&nbsp; They
are said to be found likewise among the neighbouring villages, but I
saw no instance of this.&nbsp; They occur solitarily, or at most in
groups of two or three.&nbsp; They appear to be more frequent towards
the immediate base of the hills, and to prefer the drier parts of those
humid and dense forests called toorai.&nbsp; They are frequently of
vast size, and by this as well as their dense head, may be at once recognised
even at a distance of a few miles.&nbsp; Some idea of their size may
be formed from the following measurements of a large one:</p>
<pre>Circumference of main trunk,                 74 feet
Ditto, including the supports,              120  &ldquo;
Ditto, of space covered by crown branches,  620  &ldquo;
Height, ditto ditto,                  80 to 100  &ldquo;</pre>
<p>The roots spread out in every direction on reaching the ground; the
larger running along the surface, their upper portion being uncovered:
occasionally they assume the form of buttresses, but never to such a
marked degree as occurs in some other trees, such as the Simool, Herietiera,
etc.&nbsp; The supports are only thrown out towards the base of the
principal branches, not as in the banian at indefinite distances.&nbsp;
The trunk is a compound one, formed entirely by the mutual cohesion
of roots; not as in almost all other trees by the growth of parts in
an ascending direction.&nbsp; Its aspect is picturesque and varied,
occasionally putting on the appearance of sculpture.&nbsp; It is, I
think, doubtful whether this as well as some other species of the genus
are not to be considered as genuine parasites, at any rate they generally
cause the destruction of the tree on which they originally grew.&nbsp;
If this be the case the parasitism is the reverse of that which occurs
in Cuscuta, in which the plantule draws its first nourishment from the
earth, relinquishing this when sufficiently developed to enable it to
draw its supply from other plants.&nbsp; I may here observe, that parasites
are common on the peepul, contrary to the statement of M. DeCandolle.</p>
<p>The destruction of the foster-mother takes place by the mutual interlacement
of the roots, which descending irregularly, form at first a strong net-work,
subsequently becoming a cylindric binding, in the strongest possible
way to the trunk, and preventing all lateral distinction.&nbsp; The
hollow occupied by the trunk when dead may become filled up, when this
has passed away, by other roots.&nbsp; The adhesion of the roots commences
by abrasion of the bark, the union subsequently becomes of the most
intimate kind.&nbsp; The supports are perfectly cylindrical; they become
conical only towards the earth, on approaching which they divide into
roots: they are strictly descending growths, and as such, under ordinary
circumstances, they never produce leaves, etc.&nbsp; Roots likewise
issue from every section of the bark of sufficient depth to reach the
outer layer of wood, with the outer fibres of which they are obviously
continuous.&nbsp; To such an extent is this carried, that transverse
sections of young supports assume the appearance of coarse paint-brushes
or tails.&nbsp; The lenticells, which are very numerous, have nothing
whatever to do with their production; if the bark remains entire, no
roots are thrown out except by division of the apex.&nbsp; The branches
ascend obliquely, the outermost running nearly horizontally.</p>
<p>The juice is obtained from the larger; that from young parts is less
thick: an exposed semi-denuded root, is selected for transverse incisions
through the bark, from which alone the juice flows, a small hole is
made in the ground immediately beneath the incised parts into which
a leaf, generally of Phrynium capitatum is placed: it is collected in
this simple manner in a very clean state, far more so than that which
can be collected from the tree in any other situation.&nbsp; On issuing,
it is of a very rich pure white; if good, of the consistence of cream:
its excellence is known by the degree of consistence, and by the quantity
of caoutchouc it contains.&nbsp; This is ascertained by rubbing a few
drops up in the palm of the hand, which causes the watery juice to separate
(probably by evaporation) from the caoutchouc which remains in the form
of small, oblong, or round portions; and by kneading this in the hand,
and striking it sharply once or twice with the fist it acquires elasticity,
so that an additional test of excellence is at once pointed out.&nbsp;
Many incisions are made in one tree, the juice flows rapidly at first,
at the rate of sixty drops a minute from an ordinary incision, but this
soon becomes so much diminished that it dwindles to eight.&nbsp; The
bleeding is continued for two or three days, when it ceases spontaneously
by the formation of a layer of caoutchouc over the wound; and it is
to the commencement of this that the rapid diminution in the number
of drops is perhaps to be attributed.&nbsp; The quantity obtained from
one tree has not exactly been ascertained; by some it is stated to be
as much as four or five maunds, while others say that a moderate tree
will only yield one gurrah full, or about ten seers.&nbsp; From the
slowness with which it flows, I should consider half a maund to be a
fair average for each bleeding.&nbsp; The juice is, however, said to
flow faster at night, but this demands verification.</p>
<p>The operation is repeated at the end of eighteen or twenty days.&nbsp;
In seven miles of jungle we observed eighty trees, by far the greater
portion of which were of large size.&nbsp; Lieutenant Vetch has made
a calculation, (on the assumption that they are equally plentiful throughout
Chardowar,) that the number in this district alone is --- trees.</p>
<p>I calculate the number to be about 20,000.&nbsp; There is no reason
for supposing that they are not equally abundant throughout Noadwar,
nor in fact on any line where toorai prevails between Goalpara and Bishnath;
beyond this, however, the increase in latitude may occasion their decrease
both in number and size.&nbsp; On the southern side of the valley there
is every reason to believe it to be equally common.&nbsp; The general
geographic range may hence be said to be in latitude 24&deg;, to 26&frac12;&deg;
in longitude.&nbsp; It has been stated by Mr. Royle that it does not
extend beyond Pundua, Jynteapoor, and Churra Punjee, but on no other
authority than that it had not been found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Taking the number of trees at 20,000, and the produce of each from
four bleedings at two maunds, the annual supply that may be obtained
from Durrung may be estimated at 13,000 maunds of the caoutchouc itself,
assuming Dr. Roxburgh&rsquo;s proportion of one to three to be nearly
correct.&nbsp; Some idea may be formed of the extent to which it is
procurable, when from the mere outskirts of the forest, 300 maunds of
juice may be collected in one month.</p>
<p>On the excellence of the Assam product as compared with that of America,
it does not become me to pronounce.&nbsp; If strength, elasticity, clearness,
and perfect freedom from viscidity, be tests of excellence, then this
product may be considered as equal to any other.&nbsp; It has been pronounced
by persons in Calcutta to be excellent, but no details have been entered
into except by Mr. Bell, who objects to its snapping: if by this we
are to understand snapping on being pulled too much, in contradistinction
to breaking, it only proves its excellence.&nbsp; It is declared to
be inferior to the American by Mr. McCosh, evidently on examination
of the worst possible specimens.</p>
<p>The size of the trees as they generally occur in the limits above
alluded to, entirely precludes all idea of any great liability to be
destroyed by the extraction of juice, the amount of which must be so
minute, compared to that of the whole tree.&nbsp; Still it may be considered
desirable for the security of the tree to limit the bleedings to the
cold months, and this is rendered more necessary by the inferiority
of the juice during the season of active vegetation.&nbsp; And if it
be possible to limit the number of bleedings of each tree to four or
five during the above period, I consider that the present 3,000 stock
cannot fail to be kept up.&nbsp; But to venture on still larger supplies,
to meet the demand for this most useful article, a demand to which limits
can scarcely be assigned, the formation of plantations should be encouraged,
the sites chosen to be near the villages bordering on the line of the
natural distribution of the tree.&nbsp; Propagation by cuttings or layers
cannot fail to be of easy and rapid application; and if we consider
that the tree is the most valuable receptacle of the lac insect, there
is every reason to suppose that the natives will readily enter into
such views.</p>
<p>The jungle in which the tree occurs is of the usual heavy description,
presenting in fact no one feature in particular.&nbsp; The trees are
all of a tropical nature, except towards the foot of the hills, when
two species of chesnut and one of alder begin to shew themselves.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<p><i>Journey</i> <i>from</i> <i>Assam</i> <i>towards</i> <i>Bootan</i>.</p>
<p>Left Gowahatti on the 21st and halted at Ameengong ghat.</p>
<p><i>December</i> <i>22nd</i>, <i>1837</i>.&mdash;Left at twelve and
proceeded to Hazoo, which is nearly due west of Ameengong, and distant
thirteen miles.&nbsp; Road, through grassy plains; much cultivation
throughout the greater part.&nbsp; Passed several villages, and forded
one stream.&nbsp; Hazoo is at the foot of some low hills, on one of
which is a temple of great sanctity with the Booteahs.&nbsp; The hills
above this, as well as between this and Ameengong, abound with Cycas,
many of which were once dichotomous; on these hills a fleshy Euphorbia
likewise occurs, a sure indication of barren soil.&nbsp; Pea-fowl abound.&nbsp;
The light-blue Jay figured in Hardwickii, Sterna, Hali&aelig;tus pondicerianus,
Chat, Butcher-bird, Edolius, Plovers, Hoopoe, and Ardea indica, were
met with.</p>
<p><i>December</i> <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Hazoo, a large village, extending
nearly north and south, all the houses surrounded by trees.&nbsp; Areca
bamboos, Ficus elastica, F. indicoides, F. religiosa, Sapotea (Mimusops)
Arborea, Erythrina.&nbsp; Country to the east very jheely, and one huge
expanse of paddy cultivation.&nbsp; Fine Loranthus, Hingtstha repens.</p>
<p><i>December</i> <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Nolbaree, seventeen miles nearly,
N. by W., throughout the latter half of the way, the country consisted
of highly cultivated plains, intersected by bamboo jungles, etc.&nbsp;
Villages very abundant, surrounded by trees, especially bamboos.&nbsp;
The hedges are made of a dwarf Pandanus.&nbsp; Crossed four streams,
two not fordable.&nbsp; Grallatores and water-birds innumerable throughout,
but especially after passing the Borolia, Bec ouvert or Anastomus coromandelianus,
Pelicans, Water-hens, Divers, Ibis bengala, Cigoines (Ardea Pavonia)
Syras, Mangoe-bird, large King-fisher, Hawks abundant, of which we observed
five species; this is, generally speaking, one of the richest parts
of Assam I have hitherto seen.</p>
<p><i>December</i> <i>25th</i>.&mdash;Dum Dummia, distance ten miles,
direction north, country very open, in parts less cultivated than before,
scarcely any jungle towards Dum; this is a straggling place on the banks
of a small stream called Noa Nuddee.</p>
<p>The bamboo continues common, as well as Pandanus, Pterocarpus marsupium,
Bombax, Diospyros ebenum, which are the most common trees.&nbsp; Villages
are very numerous, but as usual, entirely concealed from view by jungle.</p>
<p><i>December</i> <i>31st</i>.&mdash;Up to this morning we remained
at Dum Dummia, and had the Booteas alone been consulted, we should have
remained there till to-morrow.&nbsp; It is a very uninteresting place,
the country consisting of one extensive plain, diversified only by trees
wherever there are villages.&nbsp; There is a good deal of cultivation,
chiefly however, of rice; some sugarcane is visible, but it is of inferior
quality, and evidently not sufficiently watered.&nbsp; Sursoo is considerably
cultivated.&nbsp; The river Noa Nuddee is about seventy yards wide,
with a stream of three miles an hour; it is full of sand-banks and of
quicksands, and is crossed with great difficulty on elephants; by men
it is easily fordable.&nbsp; The only shooting about the place is Floriken,
which are very abundant, ten or twelve being seen in one day.</p>
<p>We left for Hazareegoung, a Bootea-Assam village to the north.&nbsp;
We passed through a similar open country not much cultivated, but overrun
with grassy vegetation.&nbsp; The path was of the ordinary description,
and not kept at all cleared: crossed a small stream twice, with a pebbly
bed and sub-rapids, a sure indication of approaching the hills.&nbsp;
These, in their lower portion, have a very barren appearance, but this
may arise from the cultivated patches: land-slips are of very frequent
occurrence.</p>
<p>The grasses of the enormous plains, so prevalent every where in this
direction, are Kagaia, Megala, Vollookher, Saccharum spontaneum, this
is soft grass, and affords an excellent cover for game, Cymbopogon hirsutum,
which is more common than the C. arundinaceum, Erianthus, Airoides,
Rottboellia exaltata, Arundo, (?) Anatherum muricatum, Apluda, Trizania
cilearis, is common in the old rice khets.</p>
<p>Among these occur a tall Knoxia, Plectranthus sudyensis, and P. uncinatus.</p>
<p>I observed Vareca, Grislea, about Dum Dummia.&nbsp; Elytrophorus
is common in rice khets.</p>
<p>Towards Hazareegoung we came on a high plain, covered principally
with S. spontaneum.&nbsp; Among this occurred Lactuioides, Premna herbacea,
Grewia, with here and there Pterygodium.&nbsp; I observe here Bootea
bamboo baskets made water-proof by caoutchouc; this is a practice much
adopted by the Booteas: and the trees are here.&nbsp; The large coloured
stipul&aelig; are peculiar to the young shoots cultivated, they are
often a span long.&nbsp; The young fruit is enveloped by three large
coloured scales, which originate from the annuliform base; this is hence
a peduncle, not a bracte, as I before supposed.</p>
<p>January 1st, 1838.&mdash;Halted.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Marched to Ghoorgoung, a small village,
eight miles from Hazareegoung and nearly due north.&nbsp; We crossed
similar grassy tracts: the country gradually rising as we approached
the hills.</p>
<p>Very little cultivation occurred.&nbsp; Crossed the Mutunga, now
dry, but the breadth testifies to its being a large stream in the rains,
as the boulders do to its being a violent one.&nbsp; The same plants
continue; small jungle or wood composed of Simool.&nbsp; Trophis aspera,
Cassia fistula, Bauhinia, Butea scandens, Byttneria, underwood of Eranthemum,
and another Acanthacea.</p>
<p>About this place Cnicus and Arundinaria occur, and a small Santalaceous
or Olacineous plant, with the habit of a Polygala.&nbsp; Merops apiaster
is very common.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;To Dewangeri, distance eight miles.</p>
<p>Our route hither lay for the greater portion up the bed of the Durunga,
the stream of which makes its exit about one mile to the west of Ghoorgoung.&nbsp;
After ascending its bed for some time, the ascent becomes steep, for
perhaps 800 or 1,000 feet, when we reached a portion of Dewangeri, but
two or three hundred feet below the ridge on which the village is situated.&nbsp;
The hills bounding the watercourse are very steep, many quite perpendicular,
owing to having been cut away; generally they are of decomposed granite
as at Dacanara, in some parts of conglomerate.</p>
<p>The torrent contains but little water, and very few fish, the banks
are wooded tolerably well, as soon as the lower barren ranges are past.</p>
<p>At the base Cassia fistula, Leguminous trees, Artemisia, Simool,
Spathodea, Bignonia indica, Sterculia, C&aelig;salpinea, Phlogacanthus
thyrsiflorus, P&aelig;deria f&aelig;tida, Eugenia, Rhamnea, Croton malv&aelig;foliis
are found among the usual grasses, which form the chief vegetation.</p>
<p>These continue along the sandy bed for some time, but afterwards
the usual small Andropogons usurp their place.&nbsp; Anthistiria arundinacea
continue longest; with some of the large Saccharum, Rubus moluccanus
soon appears, with Melica latifolia, and a species of Rhus.</p>
<p><i>Leptospartion</i> is very common up to 1,000 feet, Pandanus 3-500
feet, but soon ceases; the higher precipices abound with an elegant
palm tree, habitu Cocos.</p>
<p>Fleshy urtice&aelig; and Aroideum become common at 300 feet, along
the shaded watery banks, and continue so long as shade and humidity
are found.&nbsp; Equisetum commences at 300 feet, Arundo, Saurauja,
Pentaptera, which last ascends to 1,000 feet, as does Dillenia speciosa,
Castane&aelig; feorox commences at 500 feet.&nbsp; Between this and
the Choky, Polypodium, Wallichianum arboreum, Davallia grandis, Oxyspora,
Musci, Goodyera, and Composita arborea are found.</p>
<p>At the Choky, the elevation of which is 965 feet, &OElig;sculus begins.&nbsp;
Wallichia,* &OElig;schynanthus, Urtica gigas,* Derngia,* Govania,* Anthistiria
arundinacea, Alstonea, Angiopteris, are found.&nbsp; Grislea is found
as high as 1,000 feet.&nbsp; Ficus obliquissima is found at 300 feet,
and Ficus altera species as high as 700 feet.</p>
<p>At 1,200 feet Rubi sp., Panax, Cordia, are found, and on the steep
ascent, Hastingsia,* Gordonia, Eurya, Corisanthera, Griffithia.</p>
<p>At one place the jack fruits, Ficus elastica, Compositi arborea,
Panax altera species.</p>
<p>Dewangeri occupies a ridge 200 feet above our halting place, the
elevation of which is 2,031 feet.&nbsp; The view to the north is confined
to a ravine of 1,500 feet deep, at the bottom of which runs a considerable
mountain torrent: to the SW. plains are visible, to the east and west
the view is hilly.</p>
<p>The village itself is a poor one, containing perhaps sixty houses,
but these are divided into three or four groups; the houses, with the
exception of three or four stone and lime ones, are of the usual build,
viz. of bamboo, and raised on muchauns.&nbsp; Filth and dirt abound
every where, and the places immediately contiguous to the huts are furnished
plentifully with various ordures.</p>
<p>Along the ridge three or four temples occur, these are of the Boodhistical
form: they are composed entirely of slate, are white-washed; none are
of any size, and the workmanship is rude in the extreme; on each face
of the square basement, slabs of slate with inscriptions are visible,
and in one instance many of these are ranged along a longish wall.&nbsp;
The Pagodas are surrounded with long banners, with inscriptions fastened
longitudinally to bamboos.&nbsp; On the west side of this the view is
remarkably pretty, embracing all the temples, part of the village, and
the Rajah&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The hills adjoining being considerably
diversified and remarkable, and for India over picturesquely wooded.</p>
<p>The pucka houses are ungainly structures, the height being out of
all proportion to the width, the walls are very thick, and composed
of slate slabs, the roof is choppered with projecting eaves, the windows
are very narrow.&nbsp; Each has three stories, the middle one being
occupied by the owner, this is divided into several rude compartments,
each of which has one or two balconies.</p>
<p>The steps are rude and awkward, consisting of notches cut into large
blocks.&nbsp; The cooking is carried on, on the ground floor, much to
the edification of the residents above.&nbsp; Dirt abounds in every
direction.&nbsp; The doors are rudely constructed of wood.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;To-day was occupied by moving up
into the village, in which we occupy a pucka house.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Visited the Sooba or Rajah, his
house is very picturesque, reminding me much of the pictures of Swiss
cottages: it is white-washed, with a red belt.&nbsp; The interior is
capacious; the state room has hangings, which are decorated with native
pictures on cloth.&nbsp; At the east end is a recess in which are some
well-executed Chinese statues, the chief figure is of large dimensions,
and is intended to represent the Durmah Rajah, whose statue is supposed
to give infallibility.&nbsp; Two bells were suspended, one from the
centre, the other from the balcony, the tongues of which were long,
of ivory, and moved by a string.&nbsp; The Rajah received us in state,
amidst discordant sounds of horns, pipes, and drums; his followers for
the most part were badly clothed, the few decent looking persons being
only decent externally.&nbsp; He was seated on a raised dais and was
well dressed.&nbsp; He is a stout Chinese looking man, about 50 years
old, and his deportment was certainly easy and dignified.&nbsp; The
meeting was very friendly, but it is evident that we shall be delayed
here at least seven days.</p>
<p>The central room in the Rajah&rsquo;s house is used as a guard house!
arms were fixed round the walls, but they seemed to consist chiefly
of spears, swords, and bucklers.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;I walked this morning to a village,
a mile to the west, in which there is a picturesque pucka house of religion.&nbsp;
What pleased me especially was a specimen of a juniper, of extreme elegance,
with drooping branches.&nbsp; The house itself was of the usual form,
and one end was occupied as usual by an ornamental window and balcony.&nbsp;
I noticed in addition Ulmus and Quercus.</p>
<p>The vegetation hitherto seen about this, consists of mango trees,
several species of fig, among which were Ficus indica, elastica, terminalioides,
Papyrifera, etc. two with cordate leaves occur.&nbsp; Ulmus, Quercus,
Bombax, Juniperus and Pinus, both cultivated.&nbsp; Aralia or Panax,
four or five species, Croton malv&aelig;folium, Justicia, Adhatoda,
Peristrophe, Amaranthace&aelig;, Artemisia, Urtica urens? and heterophylla,
Pogostemon, Triumfetta, (these occupy the old cleared spots,) Castane&aelig;
sp.? Artocarpus integrifolium, Erythrina, Sambucus ebulus, Rubi, three
species, Solanum farinaceum, Engeldhaardtia, Pandanus, Leptospartion,
Calamus, Nauclea, Euphorbia carnosa, foliis ligulatis, Artocarpus chaplasha,
the fruit of which is eaten, Phlebochiton extensus, Sedgwickia cerasifolia,
Callicarpa arborea, Porana, Randia, sugarcane, citrons, tobacco.</p>
<p>The fauna contains two or three squirrels, one of which is the small
one of Upper Assam, Trocheloideus, the lesser Edolius or Drongo minor.&nbsp;
Mainas, two kinds, carrion crows, Bucco, Muscipeta flammea, and one
or two other species, Parus, two or three species, kites, large tailor-birds,
sparrows.&nbsp; The black-bird of the torrents, and the usual water-birds,
black pheasants; bulbuls very common, Bucco barbatus, parroquets, barking
deer.</p>
<p>The temperature being 58&deg;61', water boiled at 208&deg;.&nbsp;
The mean of two observations accordingly gives the altitude as 2,165
feet above the sea.</p>
<p>The number of houses is about 130, but these form two or three detached
villages.&nbsp; The population is considerable, and there is no want
of children.&nbsp; The people are stout and very fair, with ruddy cheeks,
but abominably dirty.&nbsp; Some of the men are six feet in stature.&nbsp;
We had one opportunity of witnessing their practice with the bow, but
only two or three of the dozen candidates were decent shots.&nbsp; The
mark was a very small one, and the distance 120 steps, but none hit
it during the time we looked on, nor even the circular patch of branches,
on which the slab of wood of this form was placed.&nbsp; The practice
was accompanied with the usual proportion of noise and gesticulations.</p>
<p>There is very little cultivation on the hills around, so that this
people are, at least about here, evidently dependent on the plains for
their supplies.&nbsp; The cattle are a good breed, and totally different
from those of the plains.&nbsp; Ponies and mules are by no means uncommon;
there are likewise pigs and fowls, both of which are abundant, and of
fine description.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>16th</i>.&mdash;Every thing leads me to conclude
that the Booteas are the dirtiest race in existence, and if accounts
be true, they are equally deficient in delicacy.&nbsp; Although much
beyond other mountain tribes inhabiting either side of the Assam valley,
in the structure of their houses, in their clothing, in their language,
and probably in their religion, they are inferior to them in other points.&nbsp;
Thus their looms are perhaps really primitive, and of the most simple
construction; neither in their weapons of defence are they at all superior.</p>
<p>On the 14th I ascended a peak to the eastward, and certainly 1,000
feet above the village: on the summit of this, where there were the
remains of an old clearing, I observed Pyrus, Acer, Rhus, Tetranther&aelig;,
three or four species, Bigonia species picta, Carex, Composita arborea,
Pteris aquilina, Kydia zyziphifolia, Saurauja, Eurya, M&aelig;sa Panax,
Artemisia, Hedyotis scandens, Callicarpa arborea, Camellia, C&aelig;logyne,
Oberonia, Otochilus fuscescens, Ficus, Cinnamomum, &AElig;schynanthus,
Pholidota, Cyrtandra, Piper, Citrus, Corysanthera, Hypoxis, Tupistra,
Bambusa.</p>
<p>Sanicula appeared at 2,500 feet with Bartramea spectabilis, and a
small Ophiorhiza, Acer at 2,800 feet, as likewise Rhopala; at 2,000
feet, Costus and Abroma, Thunbergia grandiflora.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>19th</i>.&mdash;I find that large quantities of
Mungista or madder are sent to the plains from this, where the plant
is very common; it is exchanged for ill preserved salt-fish, one bundle
of madder for one fish.&nbsp; This fish is of an abominable odour, and
probably tends to increase the natural savour of the Booteas, which,
considering their total unacquaintance with soap, is sufficiently strong.</p>
<p>P. tells me that the Kampo country is situated north of this, and
that it may be reached by a Kampo, in twenty-six days.</p>
<p>The language of the people we are now among, is distinct from that
of Assam, as will be observed from the names given to the common grains
cultivated in both countries, their principal grain is barley, which
is of a fine description; very little cultivation being carried on here,
the people drawing all their supplies from the plains.&nbsp; The following
is a list of grains cultivated: those marked * are Cerealea:&mdash;</p>
<pre>   <i>Assam</i>.                        <i>Bootea</i>.

<a href="images/g204.jpg">
<img alt="Gradient Bootan" src="images/g204.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The palm from the cliffs on the road hither is evidently a species
of Ph&aelig;nix, pinnulis inferioribus spiniformibus reticula copiosa,
pinnulis liniaribus acuminatissimus, apicem versus canaliculatis reticulo
copioso, the height must be about that of a moderate Areca.&nbsp; No
specimens of the trunk, none of flowers and seeds have been brought
to me.</p>
<p>The temples here have a good deal of the Burmese shape, but the dome
is more like that of a Mussulman mosque.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Yesterday evening Mr. Blake&rsquo;s
Khidmutgar died rather suddenly, he had been ailing for some days, but
apparently not serious; his indisposition was owing to over-loading
the stomach with radishes, etc. in which all partook too freely during
the protracted halt, thus causing a good deal of sickness.</p>
<p>This place is so straggling that it is difficult to make a guess
at the number of the houses, the greater number of the people are temporary
residents and mostly are natives of Kampo,<a name="citation205a"></a><a href="#footnote205a">{205a}</a>
they are more dirty than the Booteas, and seem to have an especial predilection
for begging.&nbsp; When wishing to be very gracious they bow and gesticulate
awkwardly, shewing their tongue at the same time.&nbsp; Their principal
dress is coarse woollen clothes, and in lieu of turbans they wear caps
or hats.&nbsp; Their beasts of burden are principally asses, which are
perhaps, from bad treatment, undersized: they likewise use goats, and
largish animals between goats and sheep in appearance; of these we saw
one male only, it had <i>once</i> <i>spiral</i> horns.&nbsp; Even a
little black kid was not exempt from carrying its share, this was ornamented
by woollen tassels of a red colour, fastened through a hole in the ear.</p>
<p>Pemberton tells me, that most of these people come hither with the
view of going to Hazoo, a place of pilgrimage in Assam; some remain
here as a security for the return of their brethren in three months,
the period during which leave is granted by our friend the Rajah of
this place.&nbsp; Their language is totally different from that of the
Booteas.&nbsp; The day before yesterday an edict against catching fish,
being taken off as I supposed it would be on shewing the Rajah some
flies, Blake and I went down, and repeated our visit yesterday; the
bed of the river at the debouchment of the path leading towards Tongsa,
is elevated 1,431 feet, (70.209.8), <a name="citation205b"></a><a href="#footnote205b">{205b}</a>
it is of no great size, and is generally fordable; the fish are almost
exclusively Bookhar. <a name="citation205c"></a><a href="#footnote205c">{205c}</a>&nbsp;
I saw one or two Sentooreahs, <a name="citation205d"></a><a href="#footnote205d">{205d}</a>&nbsp;
and caught a long thin Bola, <a name="citation206a"></a><a href="#footnote206a">{206a}</a>
beautifully banded with purplish-blue.&nbsp; The Bookhars as usual take
a fly well, especially red hackles; the largest was caught by Blake,
and must have weighed nearly three pounds.</p>
<p>Very little worth noticing occurred in the vegetation.&nbsp; Sedgwickia
is common and of very large size, 2,400 feet above the river, as well
as tree ferns.</p>
<p>Equisetum occurs in the bed of the river; in some places at the same
level a species of Ranunculus, Aroidea, Succulent Urtice&aelig; were
common; along the edges or in the small churs, that have established
themselves here and there, and which are covered with the usual Sacchara,
but of smaller size; Erythrina, Leptospartion, Sambucus, B&oelig;hmeria
tomentosa, Kydia calycina, Grislea, Tupistra, Leea occurred, Ficus elastica
is not uncommon, one specimen presented itself, which had sprung up
on another tree, fifty feet from the ground; this it had destroyed,
and the appearance was singular enough.</p>
<p>The juice is used for water-proofing bamboo vessels.&nbsp; The general
rocks are slate, and this was the only one we saw <i>in</i> <i>situ</i>;
the vegetation is rather barren.</p>
<p>Near the bed of this river, which is called the Deo Panee, I found
a curious Menispermous genus, Columnea, Clype&aelig; perianthia uncialata,
ore integeriuscula, a Myrtacea, Uncaria, Abroma augusta, etc.</p>
<p>On ascending, Murraya exotica, Magnoliace&aelig;, P&aelig;deria f&aelig;tida,
and Bignonia, occurred at low elevations, Lobelia baccata, Wulfenia
obliqua, Costus, Chloranthus, Justicea orchidiflora below 600 feet,
Eurya occurred scarcely below 1,800 feet with Millingtonia simplicifolia.</p>
<p>The cattle here are really noble, particularly the bulls; they are
much like the Mishmee Methuns, but are distinct, <a name="citation206b"></a><a href="#footnote206b">{206b}</a>
they are very quiet.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Left at twelve, and arrived late
at Rydang on a nullah, distant eight miles.&nbsp; Passed no villages,
but passed a bridge erecting over the Deo Nuddee, at which place a Lam
Gooroo or high Priest was employed: vegetation continued the same, and
only two new plants occurred, a Stemodia with large yellow flowers,
and a Begonia, with branched stems.&nbsp; Rydang is 2,404 feet above
the sea (55.208&frac12;.) <a name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212">{212}</a></p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Started early in the morning, (at
8 A.M.) the coolies mostly leaving at daylight.&nbsp; Yet although the
distance was only eleven miles, we did not reach till 5 P.M. and many
of the coolies did not arrive till late at night.&nbsp; The fact is
the ascent was nearly uninterrupted during the day, the highest point
traversed being about 6,000 feet.&nbsp; We then descended slightly to
Khegumpe, our halting place, the altitude of which is 5,395 feet (46.202,)
at the highest point Fahr. thermometer stood at 42&deg; at 1 P.M.</p>
<p>The first part of the road lay over grassy sparingly-forested hills,
until we reached 4,000 feet.&nbsp; Here or a little below this the change
in the vegetation commenced, the first elevational plants being Serissoid;
Gaultheria, and Rhododendron commenced at about 3,600 feet on dry rocky
eminences, which it always prefers.</p>
<p>On the 1st eminence, 600 feet above Rydang or 3,000 feet above the
sea, Quercus, Castanea, Sedgwickia, Polypodium Wallichii, Lobelia, Pyramidalis,
Composita arborea, Gordonia, Pteris aquilina, Anthistiria, Gramen airoides,
Callicarpa arborea, Artemisia, Tephrosia, Flemingia, Govania, and these
continued up to 4,000 feet.&nbsp; We here met with Kampo Tartars with
their laden sheep, the children being generally placed cradle-fashion
on the top of the loads, each in its own basket.&nbsp; Itea macrophylla
occurred at 3,200 feet, with Clematis, Hastingsia, Bignonia, Euphorbiacea,
Briedleia.</p>
<p>At 3,300 feet Kydia zyziphifolia, Rhopala, Composita arborea, Hypericum,*
Triumfetta, Smilax, Indigofera.*</p>
<p>At 3,600 feet, the same with Panax, Wendlandia, Myrtacea arborea,
l. Melica latifolia.</p>
<p>At 3,800 feet, Hedychium, Gaultheria, Habenaria, Serissoides, Gnaphalium,
Gordonia, here very abundant, covered with Lichens and epiphytical Orchidea,
Phyllanthus, Emblica.</p>
<p>At 4,000 feet, Rhododendron arborea, Eugenia, l. Gaultheria arborea,

picta, Isachne, Cerastium, Spir&aelig;a, Hedera, Hypericum, Peliosanthes,
Carex gracilis rupium, which commenced at 5,500 feet, Bambusa microphylla.</p>
<p>The forests here were damp and tropical so far as herbaceous underwoods
were concerned, the trees were loaded with mosses chiefly pendulous
Necker&aelig; and Hypnea, as well as the rocks, Epiphytes were common.</p>
<p>We then continued along ridges about the same elevation, Ranunculus,
Hemiphragma, Thibaudia buxifolia, Polygonum rheoides, Pyrus indica.&nbsp;
Gnaphalium common, Pteris aquilina, Airoides, Artemisia on sunny spots,
Gaultheria, Galium of Churra, Arundo.&nbsp; The trees were about this
all scraggy, but of picturesque appearance.&nbsp; Choripetalum, Panax,
Laurine&aelig;,* Piper, Cissus, Photinia and Gleichenia major, Thibaudia
myrtifolia,* Potentilla, Calophyllum,* Hydrangea arbuscula,* Thalictrum
majus,* Crawfurdia speciosa,* Macrocapnos,* Daphne papyrifera.*</p>
<p>Our march now wound round a huge hill with rocky head, lowering several
hundred feet above us, the road being narrow, rocky, overhanging vast
precipices.&nbsp; All the trees were scraggy, stunted with tufted grasses.&nbsp;
Here about Dipsacus of Churra occurred, Buddleia, Phlomoides, Lonicera,
Rosa, <i>Jubrung</i>, Cheilanthes dealbata of Brahmakund, Asparagus,
Urticea arborea floribus f&aelig;m. capitulatis aurantiaces, Spir&aelig;a

of Oklong, Erianthus, Gymnostomum, all these on the bare rocks.&nbsp;
Along the path, Codonopsis, Cnicus, Valeriana, Hardwickia, Lobelia.</p>
<p>Hence we passed along nearly at the same elevation through romantic
paths, the vegetation being European, and comparatively open: the trees
covered with moss, with grassy swards here and there: the scenery was
beautiful, the descent hence to Khegumpa was gradual and easy, along
similar paths.</p>
<p>Noticed the following trees, etc. in the following order: Tetranthera,
Gaultheria arborea, Tradescantia cordifolia,* Acer, Polygala, Deutzia,
Tradescantia, Jasminum triphyllum, Plectranthus azureus, Macrocapnos,
Rubia cordifolia,* Cucurbitac&aelig; Cissampeloid, then forests of Rhododendron,
on the paths Swertia, Potentilla, Fragaria, Alnus Acer folius palmatum
lobatis oppositis, Porana.</p>
<p>This day I gathered about 130 species, the march was really delightful.&nbsp;
The plants marked thus * indicate elevation.</p>
<p>Madder is furnished by both Rubia munjista and R. cordifolia, these
species are quite distinct, the latter affecting greater elevations
than the former, scarcely descending below 4,000 feet.</p>
<p>Scarcely any water occurred on the route; from just above Khegumpa,
a beautiful valley is seen to the left, with a good deal of cultivation.&nbsp;
No large villages were seen.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>25th</i>.&mdash;Khegumpa.&nbsp; This is a pretty
place; but the whole country has a wintry appearance from the trees
having mostly deciduous leaves; it is a small village, not containing
twelve houses.&nbsp; Pagodas with the inscription-bearing walls occur
as usual; on a small hill rising from just below the village, a large
house with out-houses belonging to a Lam Gooroo, is the prettiest bit
of architecture I have yet seen.&nbsp; We put up in a small house, of
the usual poor construction, capable of containing four or six people,
the roofs are of wood, the planks being kept down by stones.&nbsp; The
evening was very cold, but the thermometer did not fall below 44&deg;.&nbsp;
Here a solitary specimen of Pinus was seen.</p>
<p>A beautiful tree, with pendulous leaves and cones, which resemble
those of Abies, occurred.&nbsp; Rhododendron is common here.&nbsp; Around
the hut I observed Lobelia, Rumex, Quercus, Ranunculus, Plantago, Leucas
ciliata, Gnaphalia, Rubus, Urtica urentior, Rubi 2, Pteris aquilina,
Geranium, Galium, Artemisia major, Fragari&aelig;, Betula? ramis pendulis,
foliis lineari lanceolatis, <i>Jubrung</i>, Phlomoides, in flower, Spir&aelig;a
bella, Tetranthera, Daucus, Gleichenia major, Oxalis corniculata, Dipsacus.&nbsp;
The trees were covered with Lichens; the only cultivated plants I saw,
and of these only straggling individuals, were tobacco and Bhobosa.</p>
<p>In a wood at the base of the hill on which the Lam Gooroo&rsquo;s
house is situated, Saurauja hispida, and S. arborea,* Woodwardia,* Rubia
cordifolia, Oaks, Spir&aelig;a bella, decomposita, Stemodia, Cerasus,
Curculigo, Pogonatherum,* Carduus, Polygonum rheoides, Panax, Bucklandia,
Berberis asiatica and Porana, occurred.</p>
<p>Our march, after passing this hill, commenced by a descent through
a damp wood of Oaks, Eurya.&nbsp; Here Swerti&aelig; 2 occurred on banks.&nbsp;
Clematis verbesina, Gordonia, Erythrina, Myrica.&nbsp; Thence we passed
along a ridge, the forests being stunted and wintry, abounding with
Rhododendron and oaks.&nbsp; Myrica, and pendulous lichens occurred
in abundance, but grasses predominate, chiefly Airoid and Andropogons.</p>
<p>From this to the right was seen a beautiful valley with a moderate-sized
village and picturesque houses, with considerable and very clever cultivation.</p>
<p>Thence we crossed to the other side of the ridge, descending a little
and then continuing through forests of oak, consisting of a species
found on the Khasyah hills, and approaching Q. Robur: as all the leaves
had fallen, the whole appearance was that of winter.&nbsp; Here I shot
the Jay figured in Royle&rsquo;s work: continuing to descend very gradually,
I observed Epilobium,* Neckera, Fissidens, Brachymenium, Nerioideum
in fruit and half buried in the fallen leaves; a pretty Gentiana, Ruta
albiflora, Potentilla.&nbsp; After passing along this for some way we
commenced a sharp descent.&nbsp; At about 4,800 ft. Vitex simplex, occurred.&nbsp;
Indigofera re-appeared, with Saccharum rubro nitens of Churra, the other
grasses being Andropogons, 2-3, and Orthopogon, Hedychium, Gordonia
soon re-appeared: to the east, cultivation was visible, and to the north,
Pines were visible in every direction stretching away far below us to
a considerable torrent.&nbsp; About one-third of the way down this steep
ravine, at the bottom of which a torrent was heard roaring, Wendlandia,
Spir&aelig;a bella, Hedychium, Gaultheria arborea, Aspera Rhododendron,
Pteris aquilina, Artemisia, Saurauja hispida, Indigofera, Eurya, Mimosa
arborea, M&aelig;sa angustifolia of yesterday; Osbeckia nepalensis,
Viburnum, Tetranthera, Ficus, Gleichenia minor, Crawfurdia speciosa,
Polygonum rheoides, were found.&nbsp; Hitherto the woods had been dry,
or rather so, but on turning to the east, we came into damp woods presenting
many tropical features, along which we continued descending gradually
for some time: at the commencement in this, Callicarpa arborea, a weeping
Beech, Dipsacus verbesina, and the Alnus, of Thumathaya occurred, Arbutoideus,
Hydrangea, Urtica heterophylla, Neuropeltoid aromatica.&nbsp; Then below
we came on Piper, Deeringia, Cerasus, Sanicula, Cyrtandracea, Cheilosandra
gracilis, and fleshy Urtice&aelig;.&nbsp; Underwood, herbaceous forms
of Acanthace&aelig;, Ferns, as Davallia, Asplenium, all more or less
succulent.&nbsp; Darea, Glycine, Buchanania, Saurauja ferruginea, Thalictrum
majus, Pothos, etc.&nbsp; Hypericum, Begonia, Panax terebinthaceus,
Magnoliac&aelig;, Garcini&aelig;, Valeriana cordifolia.*&nbsp; Passing
on at the same elevation, we suddenly rounded a ridge, and in one moment
came on dry, sunny, rocky, grassy ground, the trees being exclusively
Rhododendron, oaks and a few Gordonias with Airoid, Andropogons, Pteris
aquilina: we then came on the brink of the ridge up to which Pinus longifolia
ascends; the elevation of this was 4,132 feet (60.204&frac12;.) <a name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212">{212}</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From this all around Pinus is visible in profusion; we then dipped to
the south, this face being occupied by thick forest, having Rhododendrons
on the skirts.&nbsp; From the above spot Saleeka was visible, with a
fine grove of Pines, it is 1,500 feet, at least above this.</p>
<p>The descent was steep, we soon came on Callicarpa arborea, Celtis
megala, Pogostemon, Stemodia grandiflora; this was about 4,300 feet,
where a clearing had been commenced: close to this I observed Martynia,
Pteris, Composita arborea, Desmodium vestilum, Flemingia, and gathered
at 4,000 feet a Verbenaceous shrub, looking like a Plumbago, and a B&oelig;hmeria;
continuing, without descending much, I came on Pinus, Rhododendron,
Gaultheria.</p>
<p>Loranthus was here a common parasite on Pinus, oaks occurred but
the species was changed; this had small leaves, white underneath; and
descending we continued through pine woods, Artemisia minor, together
with the usual grasses and Aspideium macrosomum.</p>
<p>Here we travelled along a hill just above a ravine.&nbsp; Either
side of this was covered with grasses and pines, the ravine being crowded
with oaks, etc.&nbsp; Panax, and Composita arborea occurred.</p>
<p>A little below this, Hastingsia, common, Desmodium hispidisum, Artemisia
minor, Briedelia, Mimosa, and several Composit&aelig;: we continued
descending very steeply, and observed Holcus elegans, Melica latifolia,
Erianthus Apludoid Circium.</p>
<p>At 2,600 feet, came on Scutellaria; Pines had ceased, but on the
opposite side of the nullah, they descended lower.&nbsp; Knoxia scandens,
Kydia calycina, Hastingsia, Hedyotis linearis, Ficus pedunculis radiciformibus
pendulis, Leguminous trees as Dalbergia, Triumfetta; B&oelig;hmeria,
Asparagus, Buchanania again, Solanum, 10-dentat., Urtica urens,--l.&nbsp;
(66.208&frac12;.) <a name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212">{212}</a></p>
<p>The altitude of the bed of the Cameon nullah is here, 1,937 feet,
its banks are formed by hills cut away and hence precipitous, those
to the east are covered with Pines, Oaks descend to this.&nbsp; Here
Arundo Karka, Leptospartion, Erythrina, Artemisia major, Solanum farinaceum,
black pheasants of which I shot a male.&nbsp; Ficus Dumooriya, Grislea,
Rhamnoid scandens, Pandanus, B&oelig;hmeria torrentum, Urtica pendula,
Barleria Prionites of Dgin, Sida cuneifolia, Dalbergioid.</p>
<p>Thence we ascended 100 feet or thereabouts, and descended to another
and larger torrent.&nbsp; Anonace&aelig;, Phlogacanthus thyrsifloris
here occurred.</p>
<p>The bed of this stream is 70 to 80 yards wide, but the volume of
water is inconsiderable.&nbsp; The hills forming the opposite bank are
lofty, not under 4 to 5,000 feet; their bases and the nullah above alluded
to have the vegetation of Dgin, otherwise they are clothed with the
usual grasses and noble Pines.&nbsp; The brown bird with crooked bill
was heard here.</p>
<p>At 500 feet above the torrent Menispermum, Bidens albiflora, Megala,
Leptospartion, Verbenacea, Plumbaginea, Mucuna, Desmodium hispidum and
Ficus were seen as before: Phyllanthus, Emblica, and Grislea occurred
at 800 feet: Grewia at 1,000 feet: and Osbeckia linearis occurred at
1,200 feet in rocky places; with Poa, Cynosuroides of Churra, and Bassia
at 1,300 feet, with Emblica, Labiata sudyensis, Osbeckia nepalensis,
Ficus.</p>
<p>On rounding the ridge to the east, which is 200 feet above this place
<i>Sassee</i>, we came on a forest of oak, Rhododendron, Viburnum, Pothos
pinnatus.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>26th</i>.&mdash;Sassee.&nbsp; Our coolies left
us here, they are not very good ones, not equal to Khasyah, they are
however merry, and whistle or sing when tired, their feet are generally
naked, but occasionally they wear leathern sandals.&nbsp; Thermometer
60&deg;: water boiled at 204&frac12;&deg;: altitude 4,109 feet.</p>
<p>About this place I first met with Thlaspi bursa pastoris, Malva rotundifolia
also occurs, Ligustrum, Adhatoda! Euphorbia ramis 4-gonis, foliis? in
spinis abeuntibus! Bambusa, Urtica urentior, Geranium, Rumex of Khegumpa,
Pancratium or Crinum! Peristropha triflora, Holcus elegans, Pteris aquilina
both Artemisias, Panicum cynosuroides! Stemodium ruderalis! Callicarpa
arborea! Cerasus, Pyrus indica and malus, Barleria prionitis! Ervum,
Hedychium coronarioides! in wet places, Buchanania, Peperomia, Moschosma!
Dendrobium! Thibaudia myrtifolia, Gordonia, Dioscorc&aelig;! Tetrantheroid
arbor magna, Pinus longifolia, Quercus, 2-sp. Rhus, Citrus also is found.&nbsp;
Thus the mixture of forms is nearly excessive, those marked ! thus indicate
usually low elevations.&nbsp; Rubia cordifolum.</p>
<p>The whole four leaves of this plant are petiolate, but one pair is
perhaps always unequal, one occasionally abortive, I look upon this
as a proof that the so-called stipul&aelig; of Stellat&aelig; are real
leaves.&nbsp; There is this difference then between Rubiace&aelig; and
Stellat&aelig;, the one has covered buds, the other not.&nbsp; The development
of the lamine before the petiole is particularly conspicuous in this
plant.</p>
<p>Buck-wheat with trisulcate seeds, and Cannabis sativa are found here;
barley is cultivated.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>27th</i>.&mdash;Sassee: temperature 58&deg;, big
metal thermometer.&nbsp; Tomato found here; Leptospartion ascends woody
ravines as far as this; of birds, the larger dove is abundant; Verbena
officinalis.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>28th</i>.&mdash;On walls about this a Lobelia,
and Stemodia ruderalis occurred.&nbsp; Sassee is a ruined village, said
once to have been large, now containing not more than five or six houses,
an equal number being in ruins.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>29th</i>.&mdash;Commenced to descend almost immediately,
until we reached the Giri Nuddee, we then ascended again 5,600 feet,
and continued over excessively precipitous rocky ground, until we reached
the nullah again.</p>
<p>The same vegetation continued until we had descended some hundred
feet.&nbsp; Pinus, Quercus, Rhododendron, Viburnum, Indigofera, Osbeckia
nepalensis, Desmodium, Gaultheria arborea, Rubus, deltoidifolius, Conyza,
Saurauja ferruginea, Crawfurdia speciosa, Labiata sudyensis, Dipsacus
occurs but is rare, Gordonia, Rubus id&aelig;us, Gleichenia minor, Pendulous
lichens, Galium asparagus, Engeldhaardtia, Smilax.</p>
<p>The descent was steep.&nbsp; Thibaudia myrtifolia, Peperomia, Stemodia
grandis, Airoid, Otochilus linearis.</p>
<p>At 300 feet Composita arborea, and penduliflora, Polygonum rheoides,
Flemingia, and a cleared spot with Zea Mays.&nbsp; 400 feet Pteris aquilina,

Moschosma, Mimosa arborea, Millet, Cerasus, Hedyotis, Plectranthus,
Roylia, Knoxia Scandens, Ruta albiflora, Rottlera, commenced at 500
feet.&nbsp; Stemodia, Hovenia, Cerastium, 4-Ovulatum, Carex.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Gradient Khegumpa to Sassee" src="images/g216.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Carex, Kydia, Jujubifolia, Randia, Hovenia, occurred at 600 feet,
with Rhopala, Panax, Ficus obliqua.</p>
<p>Then shady jungle commenced, underwood of Ferns, Acanthace&aelig;,
Urtice&aelig;, Andropogons, Stemodia secunda occurred at 700 feet. <a name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a">{217a}</a>&nbsp;
Hastingsia, Pogostemon, Kydia calycina, Glypea, Curculigo, 750 feet,
with Clematis Cana, Cerasus, Quercus Robur, this came down a ridge.&nbsp;
Rhus acidissima.</p>
<p>Scleria, Lycopodia, M&aelig;sa, Sterculia Balanghas, and Kydia Jujubifolia,
at 900 feet. <a name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a">{217a}</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Phlomoides, Acanthacea specicosa, Pothos pinnatus, Choulmoogrum, Malpighiacea,

Hedysarum acenaciferum, at 1,200 feet. <a name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a">{217a}</a></p>
<p>The altitude of the bed here is 3,112 feet (64.206.2: of Woollaston,
6.4.3) <a name="citation217b"></a><a href="#footnote217b">{217b}</a>
and along its banks Cissus, Woodwardia, Megala, Polygonum Rheoides,
Mimosa arborea, Curculigo, Woodwardia, Andropogon fuscum, Conaria, Potentilla,
Rumex, Rubia cordifolia, Drymaria, and Begonia occurred.</p>
<p>The ascent was steep, leading over several land slips, the same vegetation
continuing.&nbsp; Oaks, Pines, Rhododendrons occupying the more exposed
faces, and the usual humid jungle characterising aspects not so much
exposed.&nbsp; Pinus longifolia strays down to within 100 feet of the
nullah.&nbsp; We passed a pretty cascade discharging a considerable
body of water: here at 200 feet <a name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a">{217a}</a>
above the nullah, I observed Crotalaria juncea, the Betula of Thumathaya,
Quercus lanatus, Leea crispa, Panax terebinthaceus, Indigofera, Scutellaria,
Clematis, Cana, Panax altera, Mimosa, Porana, Arundo karka, Flemingia,
Conyza, Aspidium macrosomum.</p>
<p>At 400 feet, <a name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a">{217a}</a>
Itea macrophylla, Ficus, Composita arborea.&nbsp; The woods are dry,
but little occurring underneath the trees, except the usual grasses,
Andropogons and Airoides.&nbsp; At 500 feet, <a name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a">{217a}</a>
Thibaudia myrtifolia, Triumfetta mollis, Composita penduliflora, Lysimachia,
Pinus, Rhododendron.&nbsp; The ground now became excessively rocky,
the road winding along at the same elevation, not more than a foot wide.</p>
<p>At 600 feet, <a name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a">{217a}</a>
Desmodium vestilum, Artemisia, Acanthacea lurida, Gentiana, as before.&nbsp;
Gordonia, Bambusa, Microphylla, Arum viviparum, Tussilaginoid, Wendlandia,
Thibaudia, <i>variegatoides</i>, and a myrtifolia; Sedum, rocks strewn
in every direction covered with Sedum and epiphylical orchide&aelig;.</p>
<p>On rounding a ridge with a north-east aspect we came without altering
our elevation, on a humid jungle.&nbsp; Pothos pinnatus and red, Ferns,
Acanthace&aelig;, Choripetalum, Calamus, Acrostichea, Blakea, Grammitis
decurrens, Moschosma.&nbsp; We descended through similar jungle with
Pandanus also occurring until we again changed our aspect, when the
oak woods, etc. reverted with Rhododendron and Thibaudia myrtifolia;
again changing, we returned to an intermediate jungle, gradually assuming
all the humid characters of those places passed before.&nbsp; Here I
observed Tupistra, Asplenium nidus, at 200 feet above the bed of a nullah.&nbsp;
Rottleria, Mimosa arborea, Crawfurdia, Speciosa, Zanthoxzlon triphyllum.</p>
<p>Along the bed of this nullah, Crawfurdia speciosa, Potentilla, Choripetalum,
Eurya, Ranunculus, Cardamina, Juncus! Oxyspora, Saurauja hispida, occurred;
some in a sort of marsh, with Thibaudia variegatoides.&nbsp; The places
along which torrents formerly flowed were occupied by Typha elephantina,
Kujara, Megala, Arunda, the Alnus of Bhailseeree, Artemisia major, Rubus
deltoidifolia, (Corysanthera hispida with Juncus;) here Anthistiria
arundinacea, Artemisia minor, Bucco grandis (Bird), Polygonum rheoides,
B&aelig;hmeria torrentum, Gaultheria deflexa, Indigofera, Oaks, Gordonia,
Holcus elegans, Conaria nepalensis in flower, and Erythrina occurred
along the bed, up which we proceeded about a mile.</p>
<p>We then ascended among Pines and Oaks, Callicarpa arborea, and others,
ascending up the humid ravines, which in the rains give exit to torrents&mdash;at
300 feet noticed a different Pinus, which is observed in abundance on
a mountain on the opposite side, up which it ascends 2 or 3,000 feet.</p>
<p>Callicarpa azurea, Buddleia Neemda, Eugenia, Serissoides, and the
Saccharum of Churra, occurred here.</p>
<p>The ascent was continual but gradual, rounding the almost precipitous
face of the hill, the path was stony, often loose and frequently not
above a foot wide, with a precipice lowering above and yawning beneath.&nbsp;
The vegetation had, with the exception of the Pines, Oaks, and Rhododendrons,
all been burnt, so that the ascent was uninteresting.&nbsp; As we neared
the summit it became bitterly cold, a strong biting wind nearly cutting
us in two: we reached Bailfa, which is on the summit but sheltered,
at 6 P.M.</p>
<p>Conaria occurs at the top! being more advanced in flower than below;
in one instance with young capsules.&nbsp; I noticed Pogonatherum, Didymocarpus
contortus, Serissoides, Gaultheria fruticosa, Polytrichum fuscum, gathered
at 7,000 feet, previously: at 1,200-1,500 feet above the nullah, Indigofera
reaches the top.&nbsp; In a sheltered place here I found a beautiful
Gaultheria; a small Campanula occurs on the rocks at from 1,000 feet
upwards.</p>
<p>BAILFA or <i>Bulphai</i>.&mdash;This place is 6,808 feet above the
level of the sea, yet on the east and south are mountains towering far
above it.&nbsp; Snow is said to fall in February, but sparingly&mdash;the
hills around are bleak, thinly vegetated, except those on the south
of the Geerea, which are more wooded.&nbsp; There are only a few houses.&nbsp;
Turnips and barley are cultivated here, and in these fields may be found
a Cruciferous annual, and probably a small species of Lamium.&nbsp;
The chief cultivation is visible in the valleys below.&nbsp; Buckwheat
is among the number.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>29th</i>.&mdash;To-day I sallied out a few hundred
yards to the west, on turning over the ridge, the south side of which
is so bleak, thinly covered with Q. lanata and Rhododendrons, I found
myself in a thick shady jungle, the chief tree being a species of oak,
widely different from Q. lanata.&nbsp; The trees and shrubs are loaded
with mosses, especially pendulous Necker&aelig;, Daltoni&aelig;, Hypne;
Hookeria, Fissidens, etc. occurred on the ground.&nbsp; I imagine, I
gathered twenty-five species of mosses here.&nbsp; Ferns were likewise
abundant; I noticed Daphne papyracea, Berberis asiatica, Conyza nivea,
Smilax ruscoides, &OElig;schynanthus venosus, Hedera, Ophiopogon linearis,
O. latifolius, Cymbidium viridiflorium, Ardisia crenata, Carex, Piper!
Clematis, Gordonia, Spir&aelig;a decomposita, Composita volkamerifolia,
Cissus, Smilax, Bambusa microphylla, Viburna, as before.&nbsp; Gaylussacia
serrata and microphylla, the former in fruit.&nbsp; Thibaudia lanceolata,
buxifolia, Gaultheria of yesterday.</p>
<p>On the exposed face Santalacea, Gentiana, Hypericum decussatum of
Moflong, Leucas ciliata, Isch&aelig;mum pygm&aelig;um, on Rhododendron,
Loranthus obovatus.&nbsp; The mosses of this side were Brachymenium,
Tortula, Famaria, Trichostomum, Necker&aelig;, Polytrichum fuscum, Zygodon?
Dendrobium and Otochilus, occur here.&nbsp; A stray and small Abies
occurs on the ridge itself.</p>
<p>About the village of Bailfa, occur Urtica urens, Artemisia major,
Saccharum aristatum, Rubus triphyllus, Senecio scandens, Rumex, Chickweed,
Stemodia ruderailis, Lactucoidea murorum, Carduus, Phlomoides, Rubus
deltoidifolies, Achyranthoid, densa.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>30th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer at 7 A.M. 40&deg;.&nbsp;
The houses here are roofed with split bamboos, and they are tied on
by rattans, a precaution rendered necessary by the boisterous winds
which prevail.&nbsp; The place is very cold; the thermometer varying
from 40&deg; to 52&deg;; mean temperature of the day 46&deg;.</p>
<p>In the barley fields I noticed Fumari&aelig; sp., Potentilla and
Cynoglossum.&nbsp; Erythrina ascends to this!&nbsp; Pyrus Malus and
Spir&aelig;a bella occur.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>31st</i>.&mdash;Our march this day commenced with
an ascent of a ridge lying to the north-east of our halting place, this
occupied us some time, and at last we reached a pagoda, visible from
Bailfa, and which is nearly 1,000 feet above that place.&nbsp; Thence
we descended about a hundred feet, through a well-wooded situation.&nbsp;
Emerging thence at about the same elevation, we crossed barren bleak
downs; the ravines being alone wooded, and hence the woods had that
rounded, defined appearance, so remarkable in some parts of the Khasya
hills.</p>
<p>Thence the descent was continued to Roongdong, the march is an easy
one, about seven miles.</p>
<p>The first new plant that occurred was an Allium on rocks, but it
had been dried up by the fires which had bared the surface of the hill
of every thing, except the trees and stouter shrubs, capable of resisting
its action.</p>
<p>Toward the pagoda, on the summit of the ridge, Pendulous lichens
were abundant, Epiphytes were common, consisting chiefly of Orchide&aelig;,
with the 2 Gay Lussacias, Rhododendron punctata, Hymenopogon parasiticus,
Orthodon, Tussilaginoid, Alnus occurred at 7,300 feet.&nbsp; The other
vegetation continued.</p>
<p>At 7,400 feet, a new Quercus appeared, this, which has in its young
state, leaves much like those of the Holly, and may therefore be called
Q. <i>elicifolia</i>! Andropogon, Viburnum c&aelig;rulium, Neckera,
Bambusa microphylla, Fragaria, Potentilla, Conyza nivea, Scabiosa Spir&aelig;a
decomposita, Gillenioides, Smilax ruscoideus, Hyperica of Moflong, Campanula,
Swertia, Dipsacus.</p>
<p>At 7,500 feet, Epilobium, Rosa, Vaccinium cyaneum! Rhododendron coccineum,
Tetranthera.</p>
<p>At 7,800 feet, Abies pendulifolia, Hemiphragma.</p>
<p>At the pagoda, and about it, Grimmia was found on rocks, with the
usual pendulous Necker&aelig;, Q. ilecifolia, Vibura, Hypericum.</p>
<p>Abies Brunoniana, a large solitary tree, with pendulous branches,
Tetranthera, Laurine&aelig;, Smilax gaultherifolia, Ilex, on the wooded
side of the ridge.&nbsp; Ferns and mosses were abundant, Ilex! Daphne
papyracea.</p>
<p>Eurya, Panax rhododendrifolia, Rhododendron arborea, minus et majus.&nbsp;
The tree of Thumathaya foliis ad apicem ramorum aggregatis, petiolis
colorat., Celastrinea Euryifolia, Tetranthera another species without
leaves.&nbsp; In the more moist places a small Urtice&aelig;, Lonicera
as before, on the exposed side stunted Q. ilecifolia, Dipsacus, Gnaphalia,
Vaccinium cyaneum, and Gramine&aelig;, Hemiphragma, Potentilla, Campanula,
Tussilaginoides.&nbsp; Long tailed grey monkeys.</p>
<p>The ridge we crossed, runs up into a bleak ridge on which are houses,
and which cannot be under 9,500 feet high, about the descent through
the wood, which did not extend many hundred yards.&nbsp; I noticed Galium,
Valeriana, Crawfurdia fasciculata, Sph&aelig;ropteris Betula corylifolia,
Hypericum, Spir&aelig;a gillenioides, Rubus cordifolius, Senecio scandens,
Juncus effusoideus, in wet places, Rhododendron majus, coming into flower,
(flower white) Cerastium bacciferum, arborea, canescens, Cissus, Rubus
moluccanus, El&aelig;agnus, Rubus potentillifolia, Plantago, Ligustrum,
Berberis pinnata and asiatica, which last is generally covered with
lichens.</p>
<p>Xanthoxylum, Lilium giganteum! Polytrichium fuscescens, Trichostomum
anielangioides, Pohlia, on walls and rocks, Adoxa! in wet places under
banks, with a fleshy Urticea: about this was observed the brick-red
and black bird. <a name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221">{221}</a></p>
<p>Along the naked ridge and on the downs, which had a most wintry appearance,
and where it was bitterly cold, the Lycopodium of Surureem was found,
also Vaccinium cyaneum, Gnaphalium, Pteris aquelina stunted, Hypericum
of Moflong, Swertia stunted, Hemiphragma.</p>
<p>The defined woods are formed of oaks and stray Abies pendulifolia,
Panax rhododendrifolia, Berberis asiatica, and B. pinnata.</p>
<p>Mespilus microphyllus, Rhododendron minus, and R. arborea, (Euphorbia,
and Juncus on the swards.)&nbsp; Eurya, Gaultheria arborea, Stauntonia.&nbsp;
From this ridge a village near Benka is visible, as well as a large
stream, the Goomrea, and several villages.&nbsp; The one we now inhabit,
being the best looking and occupying a deep valley, is surrounded with
much terrace cultivation.</p>
<p>Descending still farther we left the downs, first coming into the
scraggy woods of Oaks, Rhododendron, Quercus, chiefly Q. robur.&nbsp;
About here we met abundance of people going to Hazoo from Kampo; they
were accompanied with asses chiefly carrying burdens of one maund weight;
few goats; one yak was seen of a black colour; a low compact animal,
much resembling, except in the absence of a hump, the bison: it was
not a handsome specimen.&nbsp; We also passed a village to the left,
containing about twenty houses, here a Nai gooroo, or person of rank,
resides, and here I also got fruit-bearing specimens of Abies pendula.</p>
<p>Noticed, as I descended, Pyrus, Cerasus, Magnoliacea, Gaultheria
arborea and frutex, Pteris aquelina, Quercus sclerophylla of Bulphai,
Viburnum c&aelig;rulescens and angustifola! Rhododendron minus, Ilex!
Aspid. nidus, Gordonia, Q. lanata, Woodwardia, Rubia albiflora, Gleichenia
major, Pyrus indica.&nbsp; Then we came to a pretty temple built like
a house, with a fine specimen of Cypress pendula, altitude of the place
7,000 feet.&nbsp; From this a fine view of Roondong is obtained.</p>
<p>Still descending a short distance came to another temple, with a
dome of the ordinary form, and a large square terraced basement, and
inscribed slabs in the recesses.&nbsp; Hence the ascent was very steep.&nbsp;
Erythrinum, Buddleia! Indigofera! Spir&aelig;a bella, Artemisia major!
Polygonum rheoides! Rubus deltoidens! Curculigo, Conaria nepalensis,
Thalictrum majus! Asparagus, Jubrung! Oxalis corniculata, Clematis cana,
Eurya ferruginea! Santalacea australas, Pyrus malus! El&aelig;ocarpus!
M&aelig;sa salicifolia.&nbsp; We then crossed a small torrent, and ascended
about 100 feet to Roongdong; noticed Stemodia grandiflora! Spir&aelig;a
bella, Conaria, Erythrium, El&aelig;agnus spinosus, Salix? buds with
velvet or woolly hairs, Martynia! Hedera! Citrus! Woodwardia.</p>
<p>The transitions of the flora were this day well shewn.&nbsp; The
plants which indicated the greatest elevation are, Vaccinium, Abies
Brunoniana, Saxifraga, or Adoxa, Q. ilecifolia, Rhododendron formosum,
R. arboreum majus, Sph&aelig;ropteris, Ilex, Eurya acuminata? Panax
rhododendrofol., Berb. pinnata and B. asiatica, Mespilus, Microphylla,
Juncus.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the Urticea at such elevation is curious, the proofs
of the wonderful effects of humidity, and non-exposure were particularly
shewn, between the exposed south face of the Bulphai mountain, and the
north-east face which was wooded.</p>
<p>From scarcity of grass, horses were here seen to feed on boughs so
high as to be obliged to stand on stones, to get at their food.&nbsp;
They are likewise fed on maize and tares; the poultry is of a large
brood.&nbsp; The cocks are atrociously noisy, two in particular had
such lengthened, cracked or quavering voices, that they were quite a
nuisance.&nbsp; We put up in the house of the Dumpa or head man.&nbsp;
It is situated on the top of a stony, and a bitter cold place, exposed
to the four winds of heaven.&nbsp; House very large, and our host a
little man with great airs, and a red coat or wrapper of coarse English
cloth, drinks intensely.</p>
<p>During our stay at this place he invited Pemberton and Blake to shoot
pigeons; the poor man thought that they would not be able to hit them,
on finding out his mistake, he put an end to the sport.</p>
<p>Atriplex is cultivated here, Mooreesa of Assam, Hempstee of the Booteas,
though seeds are used as well as the leaves.</p>
<p>The loads of salt brought down by the Tibetans on asses are packed
up neatly in coarse cloths, and weigh upwards of forty seers each.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Our march commenced by descending
gradually at first, then very rapidly to the Dimree nuddee: crossing
this at the junction of two streams, we ascended a little and then kept
along the side of the ridge forming the right bank of the nuddee, until
we came over the Monass: thence proceeding about one and a half mile,
we reached Tassgong or Benka which is situated on this river, and about
1,000 feet above it.&nbsp; This we crossed by a suspension bridge.</p>
<p>But little interesting botany occurred to-day: Chenopodium sp. occurs
in fields at Roongdong.&nbsp; The terrace cultivation here had just
yielded a crop of rice, and was now planted with wheat.&nbsp; Agriculture
would appear to be at a low ebb, and if the country is populous, the
people must be half-starved.</p>
<p>Water was abundant throughout the route: the Monass is a large stream,
but not generally very deep, although from its rapidity it must discharge
even at this season a great body of water.&nbsp; Composita penduliflora
descends to the Dimree, the altitude of which is about 3,000 feet, so
in fact did most of the plants found about Roongdong.&nbsp; Pyrus continues
half-way, Rhododendron to the bottom.&nbsp; Hovenia at an altitude of
5,000 feet, Randia&mdash;as also Tetranthera oleosa, and a new Flemingia.</p>
<p>At 4,900 feet, <i>Jubrung</i> occurs.&mdash;Clematis Cana, Luculi&aelig;
sp., Conyzoidea nivea, Kydia calycina, Mimosa arborea, began at 4,800
feet: Gaultheria, arborea, Gordonia, descend to the bottom: Crawfurdia
speciosa, Oxyspora, Aspidium, Macrostomium, and Polypodioides, Saurauja
hispida, Hypericum, Spir&aelig;a bella, Gillenioinis, Quercus, Rubus,
and Viburnum c&aelig;rulescens.&nbsp; A tree yielding lac, which had
lately been cut, and Meliace&aelig;, Rhus triphyllum.&nbsp; Hence some
snow was visible on a lofty ridge above our heads, at least 9,500 feet,
the snow descending a considerable way down ravines.&nbsp; Of birds,
Bulbuls and Bucco, were here observed.</p>
<p>At --- feet, Leguminosa arborea, Loranthus Scurrula, Kydia Wendlandia,
Celtis, Osbeckia nepalensis, a Vitex, Grislea, Pteris aquilina, Indigofera!
Acanthacea c&aelig;rulea.</p>
<p>At --- feet, Triumfetta mollis, Composita arborea, Pterospermum,
fructibus 10-valvibus, valvis lobatibus, Sem. alatis.&nbsp; Santalacea
australasica, here a large shrub.</p>
<p>At the nullah, Fici sp., Saccharum Megala, Verbenacia? foliis apice
craso lobatis.&nbsp; On the opposite side, Pinus longifolia, to within
200 feet of the nullah, Phlebochiton extensus! Solanum farinaceum! Achyranthes
densa! a Plumbaginacea which is a P&aelig;derioid Rubiacea, and another
Ficus, Hastingsia, Bassia, Labiata Sudyensis, Grislea, very common,
Emblica, Ficus obliquus were found along the road, after crossing the
nullah.&nbsp; The ridge of the mountain was rocky, barren, covered chiefly
with grasses, the Butea of Nurtung, Artemisia minor, Umbellifer&aelig;,
Desmodium vestilum, Kalanch&oelig;, also occurred.&nbsp; At the few
houses below our path, we saw plantains! and bamboos as well as mangoes!&nbsp;
The terraces here are fronted with stones: Lemna occurred in water;
Linaria on rocks; Conaria and a fleshy Euphorbia, this last, about villages.</p>
<p>The occurrence of plantains and mangoes here is curious, and a sure
sign of mild climate, as Kalanch&oelig; is of dryness; nothing could
well exceed the barrenness of the road, from crossing Dumria to Benka.</p>
<p>Benka is a straggling place, built on a ridge overhanging the Monass,
and on exceedingly rugged ground, the north face of the ridge being
nearly equally steep; the southern face, contains about fifty houses,
all of which are small and a few in ruins.&nbsp; The only large house
is the Rajah&rsquo;s, which is said to be of Chinese construction.</p>
<p>This day the Rajah paid us a visit; a tent was pitched for his reception
on the open ground before our house, consisting of a small silken pall,
with two high silken parti-coloured kunnauts.&nbsp; He arrived about
eleven, preceded and succeeded by followers amounting to less than a
hundred.&nbsp; On reaching the ground, he was carried or shuffled off
his horse and deposited in the tent amid most terrific screechings.&nbsp;
He took an immense time to arrange for our admission.&nbsp; We found
him seated on a shabby throne, with a head priest, a coarse looking
man, on his right, on a less elevated seat.&nbsp; Brass cups, etc. were
arranged before him.&nbsp; Our chairs occupied the left; a present of
fruits, onions, etc., the floor.&nbsp; The meeting was friendly, and
he promised us coolies in two days.&nbsp; He is a youngish man with
a square face, and was well dressed.</p>
<p>After we had taken leave, he feasted his attendants and the spectators
with salt-fish and rice.&nbsp; He departed about 2 P.M.&nbsp; The procession
was as follows, both going and returning&mdash;</p>
<p>A large, black, shaggy dog led by a chain.</p>
<p>A drum and drummer; a gong with a melodious sound; a clarionet played
by an old and accomplished musician, rivalling in its strains that beautiful
instrument the bagpipe; a man bearing a wooden painted slab on a pole,
on this was an inscription; a banner looking like a composition of rags;
a white flaglet; fifteen matchlockmen; fifteen bowmen; the Dompa of
Roongdong; five horses and one mule led.</p>
<p>The household; Natchees; guitar; sundries.&nbsp; Personal attendants,
looking like yeomen of the guard in red cloth dresses, variegated with
yellow; the Rajah wearing a Chinese copper hat.</p>
<p>Lastly, the priests, of whom there were about six.</p>
<p>These were the best clothed and best mounted, and evinced satisfactory
tokens of being corporeally well off.&nbsp; Their dress consisted of
a sombre jacket with no sleeves, with either a yellow or red silk back,
over this is a sombre scarf.&nbsp; They are great beggars, and the headman
was well pleased with a present of four rupees.&nbsp; In return, he
gave P. two, B. and myself each one paper of salt, similar to those
given to the lookers-on.</p>
<p>The ponies were all poor, excepting two or three of the Rajah&rsquo;s
own, which were handsomely equipped; these had their tails raised on
end, exactly like hobby-horses.&nbsp; In addition to this, each was
supplied with supernumerary y&acirc;k tails, one on either side.</p>
<p>The whole people collected did not amount to more than 300.&nbsp;
The arms, at least were wretched, consisted of culverins, which went
off with an enormous report, and matchlocks with short rests, like the
end of a pitchfork.&nbsp; The bows were long and good.&nbsp; The helmets
were worn on the head when going and coming, but were allowed to sling
on the back while resting here; they are rude iron things, like bowls,
but covered for some way up the sides with cloth in a most unbecoming
way.&nbsp; Dirt and noise were predominant; the dancing women, evidently
not what they should be, had clean faces, but horridly dirty feet, and
were very plain.&nbsp; The dancing was poor, consisting chiefly of ungraceful
motions of the hands and forearms; the singing pleasing, harmonious
but monotonous.</p>
<p>A peculiar kind of spirit called <i>Chonghoons</i> is in great requisition:
this liquor is pleasant, perfectly clear like whiskey and water, with
a small matter of malt in it.</p>
<p>Fumaria is found here much more advanced than that at Bulphai, Drymaria
ovata.&nbsp; They cultivate one sort of Legume, perhaps more; mangoes,
jacks and pomegranates; all these trees bear fruit towards the end of
the hot weather.&nbsp; A young mango tree was observed with opposite
leaves, uppermost pair one abortive nearly: thus the Mariam of Burma,
may probably present the normal form of foliation.&nbsp; <i>Adoee</i>
fish <a name="citation227"></a><a href="#footnote227">{227}</a> found
in the Monass.</p>
<p>Bheirs, papia, tobacco, banyan, of these last, poor specimens may
be seen here.&nbsp; The place is miserably poor, and as it is reckoned
one of some importance, its condition shows the barrenness of the country.&nbsp;
The Rajah&rsquo;s house is a large one, apparently consisting of a quadrangle
with an elevated story.&nbsp; News arrived yesterday to the effect that
tumults still prevailed: the Deb it was said had been deposed by treachery:
that a new one had been permanently appointed: but that the usurper
did not wish us to come on.&nbsp; Tongsa, however, said that after we
have come so far, we should advance, and that we may settle our plans
at his place.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Left: descended immediately from
the town to the bridge over the Monass.&nbsp; The descent is steep but
winding, the face of the hill being nearly precipitous.&nbsp; Close
to the river we passed a small field of Cajanus, used for feeding the
lac insect.&nbsp; The bridge is a suspension one, the chains, one on
either side, being of iron in square links; the curve is considerable,
in the form of the letter V, the sides being of mat.&nbsp; Hence it
is difficult to cross, and this is increased by the bridge swinging
about considerably: it is seventy yards in span, and about thirty above
the Monass.</p>
<p>The Monass is 1,300 feet below Benka, it is a large river, the banks
being about eighty yards apart, but this space is not generally filled
with water.&nbsp; Its violence is extreme.</p>
<p>We continued along this river some time, gradually rising from its
bed until we ascended nearly 1,000 feet.&nbsp; We continued at this
elevation until we reached Nulka, to which place we descended a little.&nbsp;
The whole march was through a barren, rocky, burnt-up country.&nbsp;
The Monass was in sight nearly the whole distance.&nbsp; Passed two
villages, both small, one on the right and one on the left bank of the
river.&nbsp; No change in vegetation occurred except that we came upon
pines, P. longifolia about a mile and a half from Nulka, coming into
flower.&nbsp; I am almost inclined to think this is different from the
Khasya species, Kurrimia, Indigofera pulchra, Desmodium, Buddleia sp.,
were the only plants of a novel nature that occurred.&nbsp; The hills
are chiefly clothed with Andropogoneous grasses, very little cultivation
was observed, but there seemed to be more on high hills to the east.</p>

<p>The Monass is called Goongree by the Booteas; its bed is very much
inclined, and tranquil pools are of rare occurrence: it is not fordable
in any place, although many of the rapids are not very deep.&nbsp; The
singular bridge is said to be of Chinese construction, and that it serves
the purpose of a chief thoroughfare, is a proof of the extremely small
population of the country.</p>
<p>Onions grow at Nulka, plantains, sugarcane, tobacco.</p>
<p>Bheirs are common.&nbsp; Weeping cypress occurs, but stunted.</p>
<p>The entrance to this village on the north-side, is through a square
building, the ceiling of which is painted, and the walls decorated with
figures of deities, white and red.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;We descended immediately to the
Monass, keeping along its banks throughout the greater part of the march;
rising however, over one or two spurs that dip into it.</p>
<p>This river varies a good deal in width, its bed, however, is generally
confined, and the stream fierce; occasionally, however it spreads out
and becomes here and there more placid.&nbsp; We continued along its
banks, crossing one or two small streams until 12 o&rsquo;clock, when
we reached a large torrent, the Koollong, up which we proceeded three
or four hundred yards, but at some height above its bed.&nbsp; We crossed
this by a wooden bridge of similar construction with that over the Deo
Panee, and the idea of which is ingenious.&nbsp; It is nearly fifty
yards wide, and about twenty above the torrent.&nbsp; It is in a bad
state, and unprovided with railings throughout the central level part.&nbsp;
The houses into which the inclined supporting beams are fixed are strong,
and built on rock.&nbsp; The fastenings are altogether of cane, and
the whole presenting the appearance given in the annexed drawing.</p>
<p>Hence we ascended a black, rocky, burnt-up mountain until we reached
Khumna, the ascent amounted to nearly 2,000 feet, and occupied more
than an hour.</p>
<p>But little of interest occurred, in fact I never saw a more barren
country.&nbsp; We passed a small village of two or three houses, and
two good patches of rice cultivation, one just below Nulka, one at Ghoomkhume,
the small village just alluded to.</p>
<p>Pinus longifolia descends nearly to the bed of the Monass, which
below Nulka is about 2,200 feet above the level of the sea.&nbsp; Along
this I noticed Hir&aelig;a, Eugenia, Vitis, Jasminum, P&aelig;deria
f&oelig;tida, Ficus, Loranthus, Scurrula, Desmodium, Aerides, Vanda,
Flacourtia, Kalanch&oelig;, Leguminosa, <i>Vanillidora</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Solani</i> <i>mookh</i>, Ceanothus, Bergera, Dischidia bengalensis,
Leguminous trees, Euphorbia, Bassia, Cheilanthes of Brahmakoond common,
Coccoloba cyanea.&nbsp; In rice khets at Ghoomkurrah, I found Lemna,
Cardamine, Rumex of Khejumpa, Cirsium decurrens, Gnaphalia, Datura,
Simool in flowers; Spathoidea, Oxalis coriculata, Cannabis, Verbesina.</p>
<p>I observed water-ouzels, bucco, water-wagtails, bulbuls, ordinary
and yellow-rumped.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/g232.jpg">
<img alt="Gradient Nulka to Khumna" src="images/g232.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Passed cotton cultivation in two places, one close to the Monass,
and one to the Koollong, both equally bad, and observed Begonia edule,
which they call Sheemptsee, and which they eat.</p>
<p>The road to-day was generally good, overhanging in one place the
Monass at a height of forty yards above, and below scarped precipices.&nbsp;
The road here was constructed or supported artificially.&nbsp; Distance
six miles.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;To Phoollong.&nbsp; Left at 9&frac12;
A.M., and immediately commenced ascending.&nbsp; The ascent was at first
steep, then gradually wound round the Khumna mountain, which was most
barren throughout.&nbsp; The ascent continued but very gradually until
we came near Phoollong, to which we descended, and then ascended about
1,000 feet.&nbsp; About half-way, and when we had ascended perhaps 1,000
feet, we came on new vegetation, oaks, Rhododendra, etc. as before,
and this continued improving in denseness until we reached the village.&nbsp;
The distance is five miles, ascent about 1,500 feet, but so gradual,
that one would not imagine it more than 800 feet.&nbsp; At Khumna, I
noticed Pinus longifolia, Pyrus malus, Achyranthes dense, Cirrus, Urtica
urens, tobacco, Musa, Datura, Artemisia major.&nbsp; Hogs are fed here
in large circular platters made of stone scooped out.</p>
<p>Commencing the ascent, I observed Ficus cordata of Bhamru, Rhus pendula,
Indigofera <i>elatior</i>, Conaria, Pteris aquilina, Cerasus commenced
at 5,000 feet.&nbsp; Then Desmodium vestilum, Artemisia minor, Conyza
laculia, Rubus deltifolius, Labiata Sudyensis, Acanth. c&aelig;rulescens.</p>
<p>Quercus robur commenced at about 5,200 feet, but stunted Flemingia
secunda, then Gaultheria arborea, Gnaphalium nivea.</p>
<p>Here there was a high ridge to the right, crowned with a wood of
Q. robur, all the leaves of which had fallen.&nbsp; Myrica, Rhododendron,
Jubrung, Didymocarpus contortus on rocks, Cnicus, Clematis cana, Polygonum
rheoides.&nbsp; At a village here, which contained ten houses, observed
Cupressus pendula, Citrus, wheat, Bambusa, then Juncus.&nbsp; Primula

<p>Throughout the march we observed many detached houses on the mountains
forming the right bank of the Koollong, and much cultivation, all of
the terrace sort.&nbsp; Passed one village beneath us about 700 feet,
containing twelve houses, and the one mentioned above; as usual, ruined
houses occur.</p>
<p>Cattle furnished with litters of leaves; a curious low was heard,
like that of an elephant.</p>
<p>Booteas work their own cotton, much of which is cultivated along
the rivers at low elevations.</p>
<p>Higher land, certainly 11 to 12,000 feet high, was visible to the
north side: on this a good deal of snow was visible.</p>
<p>[Gradient Khumna to Phoollong: g235.jpg}</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>8th</i>.&mdash;Towards the morning it commenced
to rain; snow has fallen on both sides the Koollong: it has fallen on
the road we came by yesterday, and on the hills above to within 200
feet of us, or in some places to the level of this.&nbsp; Exemption
in favour of this place is to be attributed to local causes.&nbsp; The
trees in the neighbourhood are completely covered with it, and it is
said to have fallen here twice during the night,</p>
<p>The Bootea houses are ill calculated for rain, they leak all around
as indeed might be expected, from the nature of the roofs, which consist
of boards, kept <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> by stones.&nbsp; It would be curious
to ascertain the temperature under which snow does not fall, and if
possible the temperature here and among the snow.&nbsp; In the morning,
sleet with a few flakes of snow fell also, but only occasionally.</p>
<p>Snow continued to fall throughout the day, and steadily too: it commenced
slightly: as the cold increased it ceased to melt on reaching the ground,
and at length all around was a sheet of white.&nbsp; The variations
of the thermometer were considerable and frequent, the wind blowing
pretty steadily from the south-east.</p>
<pre>At 10  A.M.  37&deg;    Snow commencing.
At 10&frac12; A.M.  36&deg;    South-east wind.
At 10&frac34; A.M.  40&deg;    Wind from the north, snow rather heavy.
At 11&frac34; A.M.  37&deg;    South-east.
At 12  Noon  35&deg;      ditto.
At 12&frac12; P.M.  36&deg;      ditto.
At  2&frac12; P.M.  37&deg;      ditto.
At  4  P.M.  39&deg;      ditto.
At  6  P.M.  37&deg;      ditto.
At  9  P.M.  38&deg;      ditto.</pre>
<p>Fine moonlight night.&nbsp; View to the north beautiful; every thing
silvered with snow; the deep and black ravine of the Koollong is particularly
conspicuous, and on some cultivated spots the pendulous cypress with
its sombre head and branches covered with snow, was also remarkable,
altogether a beautiful scene.&nbsp; Larch-like firs were visible 500
feet over the road leading to this from Khumna.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Fine sunny morning: thermometer
at 7 A.M. 35&deg;: at 8 A.M. 42&deg;.&nbsp; Hills around covered with
snow.&nbsp; High ridge to south plainly visible, a good deal of snow
visible.&nbsp; Went out at noon over to the south-east, in which direction
a pine wood was visible; this I ascertained to consist of Pinus or Abies
pendula, which has much the habit of a Larch.&nbsp; The altitude of
this above Phoollong is certainly 1,000 feet; snow covered the ground
in all sheltered spots.&nbsp; The woods here are formed chiefly of Q.
robur, Q. ilecifolia also occurs here and there, Gordonia, Cerasus,
Rhododendron minus.</p>
<p>Mosses and Jungermanni&aelig; abound, and were in high perfection
owing to being saturated with moisture.&nbsp; Polytrichum, Neckera,
Brachymenium, Dicranum, Weissi&aelig;, Fissidens, Hypnum, Didymodon,
Diastoma, Orthodon, were found in perfection.&nbsp; The only new plants
were a Campanula and a Chimaphila, which last was found at 7,000 feet.&nbsp;
Berberis asiatica scarcely occurs below 6,000 feet, Hedera.&nbsp; The
birds seen were the jay, barbet, red-and-black-headed, variegated short-wing,
large ditto of Khegumpa, orange-breasted Trochilus, brown Fringilla,
green woodpecker, black pheasant, and small squirrel of Assam was also
found.</p>
<p>From the fir wood, Tassyassee was distinctly visible, bearing nearly
due south, distance 10 or 12 miles.&nbsp; Koollong was also seen: all
the high ground between that and Bulphai was covered with snow.&nbsp;
The high range to the south is, I think, the same as that which runs
up behind from the pagoda above Bulphai.</p>
<p>A few plants of the Assam Indigo, Ruellia indigofera, are kept here,
and preserved with care, but stunted and obviously unsuited to the climate.&nbsp;
Montario, our taxidermist, says that it is the fourth plant he knows
from which indigo is procured.&nbsp; First, Indigofera&mdash;Second,
the custard apple, <i>shereefa</i>&mdash;Third, a climbing plant used
in Java, etc. probably Marsdenia tinctoria&mdash;Fourth,&mdash;?</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;Fine weather: thermometer at 7
A.M. 40&deg;.&nbsp; Started at 9 A.M., and reached Tassyassee at 3 P.M.;
the distance being nine miles.&nbsp; We continued throughout nearly
at the same elevation, rounding the hill on which Koollong is placed.&nbsp;
About three miles from this we descended about 500 feet to a nullah,
which we crossed over by means of planks, thence we ascended about the
same height, and continued at nearly our former level until we descended
to the Koollong, which we crossed by the usual form of wooden bridge.&nbsp;
Thence we ascended 400 feet to the village, which is chiefly constituted
by the Rajah&rsquo;s house, a very large edifice.&nbsp; The Koollong
is still a considerable stream, but appears to be fordable, at least
in the present season.</p>
<p>The vegetation continued the same almost throughout.&nbsp; In ascending
from the nullah above mentioned, we came on plenty of Pinus longifolia,
and on getting still nearer Tassyassee the Abies pendula became more
and more common, until it forms on the opposite bank of the Koollong
opposite this, a large wood; Pinus longifolia disappearing.&nbsp; The
hills continue openly wooded, the woods consisting of oaks, chiefly
Q. robur and Rhododendrons.&nbsp; In the ravines which are thickly wooded,
oaks, chesnuts, Cerasus, Rhododendron arborea, mosses; Panax two or
three species, among which is a new one, <i>P</i>. <i>&aelig;sculifolia</i>,
arbor parva armati, foliis 7 digitatis, paniculis nutantibus.&nbsp;
Hydrangea, Viburnum c&aelig;rulescens, and Microphyllum, Galium, Ferns
abundant, Bucklandia likewise occurred here and there! Tetranthera,
Valeriana, Scabiosa, Conaria, Holcus elegans.</p>
<p>In the broken ground before reaching this, Gaultheria nummularifolia,
Primula minor, in crevices of rocks.&nbsp; In some places Erythrina
was very common, Gentiana, Dipsacus, Sedum and Didymocarpus contortus
on rocks, Saccharum aristatum, Salix lanata, Woodwardia, Primula minor,
which grows in shade on the Khasya hills, is found here in sunny wet
places.&nbsp; The scenery in some places is very romantic, and occasionally
grand; the valley of the Koollong being closed far to the north by a
high ridge and beautiful peaks, all heavily snowed.&nbsp; The Rajah&rsquo;s
house is visible from a considerable distance.&nbsp; As we approached,
some parts were rugged and bold.&nbsp; Water abundant throughout.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>11th</i>.&mdash;Went out at 1 P.M.; descending
to, and crossed the Koollong, then ascending along its banks for about
a mile.</p>
<p>The bridge over this is about thirty yards wide, abutting from two
houses of ordinary structure, built on solid rocks: the river is underneath
the bridge apparently of great depth; above it is a succession of rapids,
it is even at this, the driest season, a considerable river.&nbsp; The
path leads in a winding direction either over rice cultivation or on
precipitous banks.&nbsp; I noticed Berberis asiatica, pinnata, a Pomacea
spinosa, foliis spathulatis, Stauntonia latifolia, Hedera, Gaultheria
two or three, Thebaudiace&aelig;, Artemisia major, Erythrina, Primula
Stuartii in abundance, Juncus, Alnus, Myrsina, Prunella in grassy spots,
Rumex of Khegumpa, Daphne papyrac&aelig;, Peperomia quadrifolium, Spir&aelig;a
bella, Viola, Ophiopogon linearifol., Hypericum, Smilax, El&aelig;agnus,
Conaria, Lonicera villosa, Epilobium sericeum, a common plant in all
watery places, Cardamina Swertia, Viburnum microphyllum.&nbsp; Rhododendrum
arborea and minor, Leucas ciliata, Thistles, Pteris aquilina, Necker&aelig;,
Osbeckia capitata of Churra, Oaks, Catharinea, Xyris, Gordonia, Fragaria,
Potentilla two, Festucoidea, Cupressus pendula.</p>
<p>The greatest acquisitions were a beautiful pink farinaceous ascapous
Primula, and a new genus of Hamamelide&aelig;.&nbsp; This plant I have
long known, and called <i>Betula</i> <i>corylifolia</i>, as I had only
seen it in fruit, and not examined it; it is found on the Khasya hills
at elevations of between 4,000 and 6,000 feet.&nbsp; It will be worth
dedicating it to some distinguished geologist, thereby associating his
name with that of Bucklandia and Sedgwickii.</p>
<p>No fly-fishing is to be had in this stream, nor indeed in any at
such elevations.&nbsp; The Adoee is found, but always keeps at the bottom,
the structure of its mouth pointing out its grovelling habits.&nbsp;
The Bookhar does not, I think, ascend more than 2,500 feet.&nbsp; Water-ouzels,
white-fronted Sylvia occur.&nbsp; Observed for the first time the religious
vertical revolving cylinders, these revolve by the action of water,
which runs on the cogs of the wheel by means of hollowed out trunks
of trees.&nbsp; Flour mills are common here, the grindstone revolves
on another by means of vertical spokes, which are set in motion by a
horizontal wheel, and moved by a stream let on it in the same way.</p>
<p>Funaria heygrometrina abounds in the larch wood here.</p>
<p>This is a very cold place, although 550 feet below Phoollong: it
is much colder than that place: thermometer at 7 A.M. 34&deg;.</p>
<p>Snow still remains on the height around; heavy snow on the lofty
ridge to the north; strong south-east winds prevail here.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>12th</i>.&mdash;Tassyassy, which is also called
Tassangsee, is a small place apparently consisting of one large house,
belonging to the Soobah, and some religious edifices, the other houses
belonging to it are scattered about among the adjoining cultivation.&nbsp;
The Soobah we have just learnt is absent at Tongsa, so we have no opportunity
of comparing his rank with that of the Tassgong man.&nbsp; His house
is however, much larger; it is situated on a promontory formed by the
debouching of a considerable sized torrent into the Koollong.&nbsp;
The bridge is at the foot of this hill, which is about 400 feet high:
the house is accessible to the north and west only.&nbsp; Half-way up
a high hill to the north-west is a fort! and between the foot of this
hill and the Rajah&rsquo;s house there is a wall with a tower at the
north-west end, and a house at the south-east.&nbsp; In the afternoon
the weather threatened snow, but it ended in very slight rain.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>13th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer at 7 A.M. 33&deg;:
at 9 P.M.&nbsp; 31&deg;: cloudy.&nbsp; Observed Conyza nivea, Composita
penduliflora, Agrimonia, Stemodia grandiflora, a species of Alopecurus
in inundated rice fields, Fragaria, in the wood, Arenaria, Gymnostomum
on the terraces.&nbsp; An Arabis in cornfields with a Viola, probably
V. patrinia, Gaultheria deflexa and Gerardia of Churra.&nbsp; The fir
woods are comparatively bare of mosses and lichens.&nbsp; Shot an Alauda,
a Fringilla, and a curious climber with the tail of a woodpecker, at
least so far as regards the pointing of the feathers, plumage of Yunx,
and beak of Certhia.</p>
<p>Fine cypresses were seen opposite Tassangsee.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Left Tassangsee, diverging from
the Koollong at that place, and following the nullah, which falls into
that river below the Soobah&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The march was a generally,
continued, gradual ascent; we crossed two considerable streams by means
of rude wooden bridges, and the whole march was a wet splashy one, owing
to the abundance of water.&nbsp; Snow became plentiful towards the latter
end.&nbsp; The direction was west, the distance about seven miles.&nbsp;
We passed two or three deserted villages.</p>
<p>We commenced ascending through woods of stunted oaks, Rhododendrons,
Gaultheria arborea.&nbsp; The chief under-shrubs being Daphne papyrac&aelig;,
Gaultheria fruticosa, Primula Stuartii, Lycopodium of Surureem, Thibaudia
myrtifolia continue, the Alnus of Beesa occurred plentifully along the
bed of the nullah. Spir&aelig;a decomposita, Valeriana simplicifolia,
Conaria, Scabiosa, Fragaria, Potentilla, Geranium, Artemisia major,
Spir&aelig;a bella, Hedera, Viburnum c&aelig;rulescens, Q. robur, Crawfurdia
speciosa also occurred.</p>
<p>Ascending, the oaks and Rhododendrons became more developed the latter
being the smaller species, Bambusa microphylla, Gordonia, Sph&oelig;ropteris,
Antrophyum trichomanes, Oxalis major! commenced.&nbsp; Larches on the
opposite side, Saccharum aristatum, Gillenioides, Gleichenia major,
Hemiphragma, Abies Brunonis commence.</p>
<p>At 6,500 feet Smilax ruscoides, Senecio scandens, Lilium giganteum.&nbsp;
The Rhododendrons here are large, forming with oaks, open woods, mosses
and lichens, very abundant.&nbsp; Here we came on snow, with it commenced
Eurya acuminata, Rhododendron formosa, majus, Rhododendron fruticosa
on ruins, Pyrus malus, Dipsacus.</p>
<p>At 6,800 feet, Q. ilecifolia, Q. glauca, Dalibarda, Bambusa very
common, Sphagnum abundant, Rhododendron formosa, majus, Quercus ilecifolia
larger and more common at 7,000 feet, Gaultheria nummulariodes very
abundant, Daltonia, Lomaria of Khegumpa, Gaultheria flexuosa, Thibaudia
acida, Tetranthera nuda, Lycopodium of Surureem, Primula Stuartii, Hyperici
sp., also <i>H</i>. <i>moflongensis</i>, are found up to 7,400 feet,
with Hemiphragma, El&aelig;agnus spinosus, microphyllum, Juncus, Alnus
of Beesa, Saccharum aristatum.</p>
<p>The village is a ruined one apparently, and never contained more
than four or five houses, situated on an open spot, surrounded by woods.&nbsp;
This spot is covered with sward, a fine Q. ilecifolia occurs about the
centre of the village.&nbsp; Its altitude is 7,983 feet.</p>
<p>The vegetation is the same, Abies pendula, Oaks, Rhododendron formosa,
majus, the other has disappeared, Bambusa microphylla, Thibaudia acida,

</a></p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>15th</i>.&mdash;We started very early; the coolies
were all off by 6&frac12; A.M.&nbsp; Our march was first over undulating
ground, either sward or through green lanes.&nbsp; We then commenced
ascending a steep hill visible from Sanah, the face of which was covered
with sward; at the top of this, snow lay rather thick, especially in
the woods.&nbsp; The ascent continued, soon becoming very steep, snow
laying heavily on the path, until we reached the summit of the second
ridge; thence we descended a little, soon ascending again very steeply
until we surmounted the highest ridge.&nbsp; The descent from this was
at first most steep, the path running in zig-zags, and being in many
places very difficult.&nbsp; About 1,000 feet below, we came on sward,
with wood on the right, along which we descended, diverging subsequently
through a thick wood, until we reached sward again.&nbsp; Here the coolies
who had come up had halted, refusing to go on, as it was already dusk.&nbsp;
Learning that Pemberton and B. had gone on, I hurried on likewise, expecting
that the coolies would follow, and continued along the swardy ridge,
the path running occasionally between patches of wood, the descent being
gradual; the path then struck off into wood, and the descent became
rapid.&nbsp; I continued onward, until it was quite dark, and finding
it impossible to proceed, and meeting with no signs of B. and P., I
determined on returning.&nbsp; I reached the coolies about eight, covered
with mud, the path in the wood being very difficult and excessively
slippery.&nbsp; I had nothing but broken crusts to eat; I procured some
sherry however, and my bedding being up, I was glad to take shelter
for the night under the trees.&nbsp; Next morning on overtaking P. and
B., I found that they had remained all night in the wood without any
thing to eat, and without bedding, and that no habitation was near.&nbsp;
We reached the village about 9&frac12; on the 16th, fatigued and dispirited.&nbsp;
Nothing was at hand, and we had no meal until 5 P.M. except some tea,
and an egg or two.</p>
<p>Many of the coolies came up late on the 16th, and some have not yet
arrived (17th.)&nbsp; The distance was fifteen miles, to the halting
place about twelve.&nbsp; The amount of ascent about 4,500 feet, and
descent 6,100 feet, the road being difficult and very slippery: snow
was heavy throughout, and the elevations between 9 and 12,400 feet;
icicles were frequent.&nbsp; The trees were all covered with frost,
and the aspect was wintry in the extreme; luckily there was no wind,
and no snow fell.&nbsp; The summit of the ridge was 12,477 feet high.
No views were obtained throughout the 15th and 16th; the weather being
cloudy and very disagreeable.&nbsp; No bad effects were experienced
from the rarefaction of the air; we all suffered of course from colds
owing to exposure at night, at an elevation of nearly 9,500 feet; the
servants bore it tolerably well.</p>
<p>At Sanah, the altitude of which is 7,983 feet, (Pemb.) I observed
Quercus ilecifolia, on it Necker&aelig;, Anhymenium, Senecio scandens,
Rhododendron arboreum, majus, Juncus effusus, Swertia, Pendulous lichens,
Dipsacus, Artemisia major, Primula Stuartii, Berberis asiatica, Bambusa

<p>At 8,300 feet, Tussilaginoides of Churra, Primula Stuartii common
on swards with Swerti&aelig;, etc. as before, Funaria and Weissia Templetonia
common, Sph&aelig;ropterus! Quercus ilecifolia, Abies pendula, Rhododendron
arboreum, majus! Dalibarda, Rubus, Ilex dipyrena! Rhododendron undulatum!</p>
<p>At 8,400 feet, the road running along, and above a ravine, rocky

bamboo, Primula Stuartii, Gnaphalium densiflorum, Swertia monocotyledonea,
Prunella in the woods, Salix lanata, and Panax rhododendrifolia.</p>
<p>Just above this, 8,500 feet, the first Abies cedroides appeared,
soon becoming very common, and extending up to 9,500 feet, its habit
is like that of a cedar, and it is a tall handsome tree, Rubia* cordifolia!
Geranium scandens, Baptisioides.</p>
<p>Crossing a nullah, we commenced a steep ascent, Thibaudac&aelig;
rotundifolia, Abies cedroides, Lomaria of Khegumpa, Crawfurdia speciosa,
Andropogon, Gaultheria nummulacifol.&nbsp; Ilex, Epibolium Vaccinium
cyaneum!&nbsp; Here a sward commenced with vegetation as before, the

Gaultheria flexuosa, Scandent composita, Cerastium bacciferum.&nbsp;
The trees covered with mosses, Necker&aelig;, Dicranum, Daltoni&aelig;,
Abies pendula ceased, its limits visible below.&nbsp; Hence the ascent
was gradual at first: snow became heavy at 9,100 feet.&nbsp; Hemiphragma,
Rhododendron abundant.</p>
<p>At 9,500 feet, much the same vegetation, Abies densa commenced, cedroides
ceased.&nbsp; Woods entirely of A. densa, with a small baccate-like
deciduous leaved tree.&nbsp; Hydrangea! Spir&aelig;acea! Urtice&aelig;?!
Pedicularis elatior.</p>
<p>At 10,000 feet, some trees all covered with frost; snow very heavy,
quite crisp, Juncus niveus, Cerastium inflatum! bamboos, other plants
of 9,500 feet, continue.&nbsp; Old Cretins!</p>
<p>At 11,270 feet, thermometer 39&deg;, the same trees, scarcely any
thing but Abies, Arenoid, Dicranum macrocarpus, Orthotrichum, Lichen
pendulum atratum.</p>
<p>Thence we descended a little, soon to re-ascend.</p>
<p>At the same elevation Parnassia, Epilobium monus, Gnaphalium densiflor.,
Vaccinium pumilum, Gentiana, Polygonum(?)</p>
<p>At 11,000 feet, icicles were common, and snow, very heavy.&nbsp;
Woods of some Abies, a species of rose very abundant, a shrub of four
feet high; other plants continue as before.</p>
<p>From this to the summit the ascent was very steep; Abies continues.&nbsp;
Rhododendron(?) very common, with rose, Parnassia, Saxifraga, Composita
arenoid, Gentiana, Polygonum(?), Pedicularis dwarfed, Triticoides, Aroides.&nbsp;
Many pines dead as if blasted.&nbsp; Summit nearly bare of trees, which
appear confined to slopes, Rhododendron very common, Umbellifera crassa,
figured in Royle, Lilium unifloria.</p>
<p>At 12,000 feet, after descent, commenced Hymenophyllum, Xyris on
rocks, Pyrus at 11,500 feet, Rhododendron ellipticum common, summit
strewed with rocks, Rhododendron pumilum.</p>

<p>All the plants above 10,500 feet, had perished, not a single one
being found in flower.&nbsp; The descent was so hurried, that it was
impossible to note down more plants; and the same applies to the descent
to this from the halting place.&nbsp; Starvation being to be added to
discomfort.</p>

<p><i>February</i> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Snow has fallen during the night
all around, but not within 1,000 feet of us: this will make the snow
line here about 7,300 feet, the village being 6,335 <i>supra</i> <i>marem</i>.&nbsp;
Mildness of climate would appear to be indicated by the abundance of
rice cultivation round this place, chiefly, however, about 1,000 feet
below.&nbsp; In every direction ranges of 9 to 12,000 feet are visible:
villages are very common, especially so in a hollow on the western side
of the ravine of the Kooree, in which I counted sixteen or eighteen;
one containing between thirty and forty houses.&nbsp; The space alluded
to is one sheet of cultivation, chiefly rice and wheat.&nbsp; Ling&egrave;
itself is an ordinarily sized village, containing about twelve houses.&nbsp;
The wooded tracts cease for the most part, about 1,000 feet above this.&nbsp;
The face of the country, where uncultivated, being clothed with harsh
Andropogoneous grasses, Salix pendula, Thuja pendula, Pyrus malus, Erythrina,
Quercus, Juncus effusus, Porana of Churra, Plantago, Barleria, Polygonium
rheoides, Stellaria media, Rubus deltifoliis, Cnicus, Rhodod. arboreum
minus, but rare, Smithea occurs also.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>18th</i>.&mdash;Our march commenced by a steep
descent on the south face of the hill, the coolies proceeding by a more
direct one to the north, but which was said to be difficult.&nbsp; We
continued descending in a westerly direction, until we came in sight
of the Kooree river which flows along the ravine, and which is a large
stream, one-third less than the Monass.&nbsp; We then turned to the
north following the river, the path running up, about 800 feet above
it.&nbsp; We then came to another ravine, and descended to the torrent,
which we crossed by a rude wooden bridge: then followed again the Kooree,
to the bed of which we descended, and along which we continued for some
time.&nbsp; We then ascended where the banks were of such a nature as
not to allow a path, descending again here and there.&nbsp; Then we
came on the Khoomun, a large torrent, which we crossed by a wooden bridge
about 100 yards above its bed; re-descended to the Kooree, reached its
bridge; and thence descending rather steeply, and for about one and
a half mile to Ling-Ling, or Lengloon, which is plainly visible from
the bridge over the Kooree.</p>
<p>After turning to the north along the Kooree, and indeed after passing
the cultivation below Ling&egrave;, which chiefly occupies a sort of
plateau, we passed through a most miserable country, the hills being
rocky, nearly destitute of trees, and chiefly clothed with the usual
coarse Andropogoneous grasses, especially lemon-grass, occurred between
Ling&egrave; and Lengloon.</p>
<p>At 5,000 feet, observed Desmodium, Santalacea australasia, Gaultheria
arborea, Indigofera, as before, Clematis cana, Acanthacea c&aelig;rulescens,
Pteris aquilina, Viburnum c&aelig;rulescens, Oxyspora, Panicum eleusinoides,
Anthistiria, Conyza, Ficus cordifoliis of Bhamree, Labiata Suddiensis,
Corearia, Rhus pendula, Airoides major, Flemingia secunda and major.</p>
<p>At 4,800 feet, Desmodium vestilum, stunted, Q. robur, Dipsacus, Epilobium,
El&aelig;agnus microphyllus, spinosus.</p>
<p>At 4,600 feet, Sedum, Campanula, Osbeckia capitata, Citrus in villages,
Emblica, Artemisia minor.</p>
<p>At 4,000 feet, P&aelig;deria cyanea, lemon-grass, Panax, Terebinthaceus,
Pinus longifolia, here and there, Ficus obliqua, Grislea, Cirsium.</p>
<p>At the bed of the torrent 4,000 feet, Bassia.</p>
<p>Over the Kooree, Euphorbia antiqorum, a sure sign of aridity.&nbsp;
Didymocarpea contorta, D. canescens, which differs from the other in
being hirsute, Menispermum, Holcus elegans.</p>
<p>Along its bed, Sedum of Phoollong, Eugenia, Achyranthis, Ingoides
arborea, Aspidium polypodioides, Briedleia obovata; Desmodium of Nulka!
Arundo, Buddl&aelig;a neemdoides, Jasminum of Benka, Composita, involucri
squamis ciliatis.&nbsp; Rice fields, in these Gnaphalium aureum, Phleoides
of Tassangsee, but in full flower, Lysimachia majus, rugosus, Oxalis
comiculata, Hieracioid, Composita, Lactucoid purpureseus, Ammannia,
Bidens alba, Drymaria.</p>
<p>Then along the wooded banks, Wendlandia, <i>Pomacea</i>? Mimosa arborea,
Camunium, Butea suffruticosa, Pterospermum of Bhamree, Luculia, Ulmus,
as before, Pinus longifolia, Rottlera, Melica latifolia, young plants
of Q. robur on rocks, along with it Goodyera articulata, Urticoid rhombifolia,
carnosa; on rocks up Khoomun, Orthotrichum corcalypta.&nbsp; At the
bridge over this, a Myrtaceous tree and the Simool occur.&nbsp; The
plants occur during the ascent, as in the descent.&nbsp; Water-wagtails,
blackbirds, tomtits, were observed, as also white-pated and white-rumped
water-chats.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>19th</i>.&mdash;Ling-Ling or Lengloon.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>20th</i>.&mdash;To-day we visited the Soobah,
who is a young man, certainly not more than twenty years old, with a
good humoured countenance.&nbsp; The meeting was cordial but unattended
with any state, and judging from appearances only, this Soobah is inferior
to the others we have seen, and especially to him of Tassgong.&nbsp;
No armed men were present, and the whole bystanders scarcely amounted
to 100.&nbsp; It was agreed that we remain here until the baggage, now
in the rear, arrives.&nbsp; Tonsa is, we hear, only four or five days
journey from this.</p>
<p>The meeting took place in an open plot of ground below the Soobah&rsquo;s
house and on the skirts of the village, the ground was matted and a
space enclosed with mats: we sat in the open air; the Soobah under a
silken canopy.&nbsp; Altogether he seemed a person of no pretensions,
crowds, speaking comparatively, of priests attended as usual, they were
the slickest looking of the whole, and the greatest beggars.&nbsp; A
hideous party of <i>nachnees</i> were in attendance, and ready to perform
any more pleasing duties they might be required; they were however so
ugly, that not much self-denial was required in declining their offers.&nbsp;
They were dressed in red, with abundance of cumbrous silver ornaments,
and dirty leggings; one was additionally ornamented with incipient goitre.</p>
<p>Sugarcane (but stunted), almonds, or peach, oranges, castor-oil,
datura, pear, simool, may be found here.&nbsp; Oranges are poor enough,
the pear no better.&nbsp; Pinus longifolia, Cupressus pendula, are almost
the only trees: the hills being barren, covered with coarse grasses.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Marched to Tumashoo: our march
commenced with a steep ascent, but which may be avoided by going through
the village, it commenced and continued throughout in the direction
of Ling&egrave;, opposite to which place we found ourselves on our arrival,
but on the right bank of the river.&nbsp; The highest part reached,
before we descended to this village, was 6,350 feet, or about the height
of Ling&egrave;.&nbsp; The march was nearly six miles, it was easy,
the road being throughout excellent and apparently more frequented than
any we had hitherto seen.&nbsp; Generally we moved along through open
Rhododendron woods, frequently very much stunted, at 6,000 feet.&nbsp;
These were intermixed with Quercus tomentosa.&nbsp; The only spot well
wooded, occurred in the ravines, giving exit to small streams.</p>
<p>The first ascent from Leng-Leng, gave the same vegetation, scarcely
any trees being visible.&nbsp; Tradescantia clavijera of Churra on rocks,
Galium of Churra, Santalacea, Desmodium vestilum, Indigofera canescens,
Artemisia major and minor, Oxyspora, Luculia, Conaria, Sambucus in wet
places, Lobelia pyramidalis, Spir&aelig;a bella and decomposita, Thalictrum
majus, Gaultheria fruticosa, Woodwardia, Saurauja hispida, Rhododendron
minus, and lemon-grass, occurred in the order of ascent.</p>
<p>Turning hence along the ridge at the same elevation, Gaultheria arborea,
Quercus tomentosa, Rhododendron minus, Hedychium, Holcus elegans, Leucas
ciliata.&nbsp; In wet wooded spots Gaultheria duplexa, Bucklandia, Viburnum
c&aelig;rulescens, Polyg. rheoides, Erythrina, Gordonia, Porana, Neuropeltis
aromatica, Catharinea, Thibaudia myrtifolia, in open massy woods of
Rhododendron minus and Quercus tomentosa, Rosa, Cnicus, Pyrus, Gleichenia
major, Agrimonia occurred at the same elevations.</p>
<p>From one spot seven villages were visible, on opposite bank of Kooree
and between Ling&egrave; and the Khoomun.&nbsp; A few stunted P. longifolia:
one or two of Abies pendula, occurred 100 feet above the highest point
of the former: at 6,350 feet, woods of the deciduous Q. robur, were
observable.</p>
<p>On the descent at 6,000 feet, Mimosa spinosa, Primula Stuartii, Rhus,
Juncus, and others, as before.</p>
<p>We passed several villages, some containing twenty or thirty houses,
and on halting found ourselves towards the edge of the cultivated tract
alluded to, as seen from Ling&egrave;.</p>
<p>Cattle are here kept in farm yards which are well littered with straw;
as in other places they are noosed round the horns: they are fed, while
tied up, on straw of a coarse and unnutritious description, which they
do not seem to fancy much. Pigeons abound, but they are of no use as
they cannot be caught; they may help to feed the sparrow-hawks, which
are generally found about the villages, and which are very bold.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Left at 8 A.M. after the usual
trouble about coolies and ponies.&nbsp; We ascended at first about 1,000
feet, passing over sward with woods of P. longifolia on either side,
crossing the ridge through a hollow, we then commenced a steep descent
to the west, until we reached a water-course, the elevation of which
is about 200 feet below that of Tumashoo.&nbsp; We then struck off,
again to ascend, and continued to do so until we attained 7,800 feet,
from which point we descended gradually at first, then abruptly to our
<i>mokan</i>.&nbsp; The direction was nearly west, the distance 11 miles,
the march pretty easy, as the road was good, and the ascent gradual.</p>
<p>Up to the ravine and indeed throughout, nothing new occurred in the
vegetation.&nbsp; The hill up which we ascended to again descend, was
bare, covered with the usual coarse grasses, Campanula linearis and
C. cana, foliis undulatis, Desmodium vestilum, Santalacea.</p>
<p>In the ravine Gordonia, Photinia, Pothos flammea and another species,
M&aelig;sa, Polygonum rheoides, Ficus of Bhamree, and in the khets Hieraceoid,
Gnaphalium aureum, Ajuga, and Veronica occurred.</p>
<p>Up the first ascent and at about 5,500 feet, there was a field of
peas, in very luxuriant condition.&nbsp; Our road lay through open dry
woods of oaks, either Q. robur or Q. tomentosa, principally the latter,
Rhododendron minus, and Pinus longifolia preponderated in some places,
but few trees of Abies pendula occurred.</p>
<p>The march was so far interesting as establishing nearly the limits
of Q. robur, Q. tomentosa and Q. ilecifolia, which last only commenced,
and then in a small state, at 7,300 feet, I should say that Q. tomentosa
was to it the next indication, as well as Q. glauca.&nbsp; But it must
be understood that only full grown trees are now considered.&nbsp; Mosses
were common in the woods on reaching 6 to 7,000 feet, principally Dicrana,
Hypna, Orthotricha, Pendulous lichens frequent; about 7,000 feet, Primula
Stuartii in its old situations between 6 to 7,000 feet, Hypericum of
Moflong, 7,000 feet.</p>
<p>We crossed several small water-courses, along these, the dry woods
ceased, and the usual humid jungle made its appearance; mosses very
numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Gradient Longloon to Tumashoo" src="images/g254.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The above plants continued throughout, after reaching an altitude
of 6,000 feet, the woods consisting of oaks and Rhododendrons.</p>
<p>The route for the most part wound along the course of the Kooree,
but considerably above, we left this track about 3 P.M. on the river
turning to the southward.&nbsp; Ling&egrave; was in sight nearly the
whole day; we have been six days (including a halt) performing what
might with ease be done in one, for there probably is a road in a direct
line between this part and the opposite bank of Kooree.&nbsp; The small-crested
finch, and red-beaked and red-legged fare occurred, the former is a
noisy bird, inhabiting chiefly woods of Q. robur, the flock were loth
to leave one particular spot, so that we obtained five specimens: the
finch occurred at 7,800 feet.</p>
<p>Various temples and walls were passed en route, and a few villages,
with one exception of average small size, were visible in various directions.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>25th</i>.&mdash;Our route hence continued for
some time at about the same level, when we descended rather rapidly,
until we reached a considerable stream, the Oongar, which is crossed
by the ordinary wooden bridge; about 200 yards further, it is again
crossed by means of a rude bridge, and the remainder of the march is
a steep, long, and unmitigated ascent.&nbsp; I reached the tent about
5 P.M.; we passed one village situated near the larger bridge, with
this exception the country seemed uninhabited: very little cultivation
was visible in any direction.</p>
<p>The vegetation was the same, for the most part, the drier faces of
the hills being covered, i.e. at about the level of Oongar, with oaks
and Rhododendrons, the wet ravines being more densely, and more variously
wooded.&nbsp; On sward about Oongar, I noticed a Pedicularis, Artemisia
major, Stellaria angustifolia, Berberis pinnata in woods at the same
elevation, Plantago, Crawfurdia speciosa, Rubus deltoideus, Alnus of
Beesa, Otochilus, Gordonia, Lilium giganteum, Bucklandia.</p>
<p>In one spot near this place mosses were very abundant.&nbsp; On one
rock I gathered, Weissioides, Orthodon, Pohlia, Brachymenium bryoides,
Weissia, Bartramioides, Didymodon, Daphne papyrifera, and Eurya acuminata,
this being about the lowest elevation at which I have seen this plant.&nbsp;
In cultivated spots Crucifera, Ervum, and at a temple about a mile from
Oongar, Cupressus pendula, and a juniper, Arbor parva, of aspect scraggy,
trunco l&aelig;vi, Cannabis, Cerastium canum in cultivated places.&nbsp;
The most common oak was Q. robur.&nbsp; The Jay, larger Brachypodium,
which always goes in large flocks, orange-breasted Trochilus and blackbird,
were likewise seen, as well as the brown finch, which was seen feeding
on Rhododendron minus.&nbsp; On rocky ground I procured a really fine
Acanthus, leaves all flesh-coloured, subscandens, spic. maximis lanato-ciliatis,
tetrastich. on this the black cattle appear to be fed, as large bundles
were brought in at Oongar.&nbsp; In the woody ravines Panax curcasifolia
was common, in these I noticed Cerastium scandens, El&aelig;agnus, Clematis,
Tetrantheroidea habitu, Sedgewicki&aelig;! Orthotrichum pumulum! Phlomoides,
and in wet spots are Epilobium.&nbsp; The descent shewed nothing remarkable:
towards the nullah I noticed Engelhaardtia, tree fern, and Gaultheria
deflexa.&nbsp; Obtained a beautiful woodpecker at 5,000 feet, with the
chesnut-pated lesser tomtit, Yunx, and speckled Brachypodium in woods
here; this last has the habit and manners of the crooked bill of Dgin.</p>
<p>The wood between the two bridges was very pretty and open; the trees
covered with mosses.&nbsp; The ascent shewed nothing remarkable until
2,000 feet had been surmounted, the plants forming the vegetation below
this were Q. robur, Rhododendron minus in abundance, Thibaudia myrtifolia,
Gaultheria arborea, Saurauja hispida uncommon, Viburnum c&aelig;rulescens,
Conyza nivea, Oxyspora towards the base with paper plant, and Bambusa
microphylla.&nbsp; About 5,000 feet, a Daltonia, D. hypnoides, was found
in abundance both on rocks and trees.</p>
<p>The change takes place about the situation of a spacious open sward;
here the jungle is thick, the trees consisting principally of Q. glauca,
which is a noble tree, with immense lamellated acorns, Pendulous lichens
are here common, Hymenopogon parasiticus, Lomaria of Khegumpa! Berberis
asiatica! Hemiphragma, Gaultheria nummulareoides, Panax Rhododendrifol.</p>
<p>At 7,500 feet, Rhododendron majus appears, the wood preserving the
umbrageous humid aspect, Eurya acuminata, Hydrangea, and about this
snow commenced sparingly, but soon became thick.&nbsp; At 8,000 feet,
Rhododendron undulata, Tetrantheroides baccis nigris.&nbsp; At 9,000
feet, Rhododendron ferrugineum.&nbsp; The evening now became so misty
that it was impossible to discern any thing; in addition, it was snowing:
these circumstances added to fatigue made me press on for the halting
place, before coming to which I passed through heavy snow.</p>
<p><i>P&eacute;mee</i>, where we put up, is a miserable hut, is upwards
of 9,000 feet above the sea, situated on an open sward, now densely
covered with snow, the accommodations being of course very miserable.&nbsp;
Icicles of large size were seen here; and we had nothing but snow for
water.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>26th</i>.&mdash;Leaving this, we commenced a long
and at last very steep ascent, the snow increasing in thickness as we
increased our elevation, the march commenced with undulations, but soon
passed off into an excessively steep ascent, in some parts indeed precipitous.&nbsp;
We crossed at twelve and a half P.M. the Pass of Rodoola, on which are
some slabs, with mystic characters, but even here the ascent did not
terminate, but continued, although very gradually for perhaps two miles
more.&nbsp; Before coming to the summit, a small hut is passed.&nbsp;
The descent was at first very rapid, then we proceeded along the side
of the mountain for a long way, at nearly the same level through woods
of Abies densa.&nbsp; On recommencing the descent, swardy patches commenced,
surrounded by fir woods, these increased in frequency.&nbsp; At length
we reached extensive fir woods, from whence a valley was visible, percolated
by a large stream to which we descended over open country with beautiful
patches of firs, and at length over extensive swards.&nbsp; I reached
the village at 5 P.M., after a march of nearly nine hours, the direction
was west, the distance eighteen miles.&nbsp; The road was very bad;
in one place our ponies escaped with difficulty, the road having apparently
fallen in, and the only footing being afforded by the thickness of the
snow: one pony was saved by placing branches under him.&nbsp; The highest
portion of the Pass near the peak was good enough. Snow was heavy on
the road, until we descended into the open fir-wooded country, it became
scanty at 9,500 feet.&nbsp; The day was gloomy and misty, for a moment,
the sun appeared while I stood on the summit, disclosing deep ravines,
one formed by the valley in which we now are, surrounded in every direction
by equally high land, as that on which I stood, and certainly not under
12,000 feet.&nbsp; Nothing visible but dense forests of firs.&nbsp;
The highest point crossed was 12,035 feet, estimating the summit to
be 300 feet above the Pass itself, which is so narrow as scarcely to
admit of the passage of a loaded mule.</p>
<p>In the open spot around the hut, Tofieldioid, which continues as
high as 10,500 feet, Cerastium inflatum, Labiata species, Conecis, which,
as on Dhonglaila, continues up to 12,000 feet, Dipsacus, Prunella, Gaultheria
nummularioides, Pteris aquilina, stunted, Juncus niveus, Gnaphalium.&nbsp;
No firs were visible, but the trees were so covered with snow, that
I was not able to distinguish them.</p>
<p>At 9,800 feet, along an open ridge, Spir&aelig;a belloides, Buddl&aelig;a,
B. purpuras&aelig;, Khasyan&aelig; affinis, Andropogones, Mespilus microphyllus,
Hydrangea, Taxus, Swertia, Gnaphalium, Thibaudia orbicularis commences,
continuing up to 10,500 feet, Brachymenium bryoides, Bambusa very common,
forming frequently the chief bulk of the forest, even up to 10,500 feet,
Acer arbuscula foliis palmatum lobatis!! Pyrus arbor magna fol. obovat.
serratis subtus albus, fructibus cerasi magnitudinum.</p>
<p>At 10,000 feet, Composita penduliflora! Hemiphragma, Lobelioides,
Brachymenium bryoides, Rhododendron minus ferrugineum, arboreum vel
arbuscula, Rhododendron obovatum, foliis subtus albus, Rhododendron
hispidum, Rosa microphylla, Bambusa, Spir&aelig;a of former ascent.</p>
<p>At 10,200 feet, Polygonum, Rheum, Hydrangea! Spir&aelig;a belloides,
Hydrangea, Betuloides.</p>
<p>At 10,500 feet, Abies densa, but sparingly, Rhododendron ellipticum,
foliis basi cordatis, Hypericum, Rhododendron microphyllum.</p>
<p>At 11,000 feet, no firs: nothing almost but Rhododendrons, R. ellipticum,
and R. ellipticum foliis basi cordatis.</p>
<p>At 11,500 feet, Vaccinium, foliis ovatis spinuloso-dentatis, atratus
fructex pygm&aelig;us repens.</p>
<p>Towards the Pass, the face of the mountain became more and more rugged,
the vegetation more scanty, consisting of nothing but Rhododendrons.</p>
<p>At 12,000 feet, Eriogonum minus, Polygonum, Rheum, Rhodod. microphyllum
and ellipticum foliis basi cordatis.</p>
<p>About the Pass, Trichostomum, <i>Xyris</i>, Abies densa, one small
plant, Rosa, Eriogonum minus, Rhododendron microphyllum and ellipticum
foliis basi cordatis.</p>
<p>On the more level ridge between this Pass and the summit, Rhododendrons
still were most frequent, Triticoides umbellifera of Royle, Eriogonum
majus, woods of Abies densa occurred a little below the path, Gentiana
maxima, 4-pedalis folliculis bipollicaribus, Lilium uniflorum, Potentilla
common between this and 9,000 feet, Rosa microphyllum, Juniperus, Epilobium
minus of Dhonglaila, Rheum.&nbsp; Large black crow, Pedicularis, Saxifraga,
Umbellifera alia, Composit&aelig;, Spir&aelig;a.</p>
<p>At the summit, no woody vegetation was visible, except Rhododendrons;
the firs being confined below.</p>
<p>The descent at first through Rhododendron, then for a long time entirely
through vast woods of Abies densa, most of the larger trees of this
are apparently blasted, it has a tabular form, and very sombre appearance,
and can be recognized even at great distances by its black columnar
palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>At 11,000 feet, Acer sterculiacea, Rosa microphylla, Ribes, which
ceases below 10,000 feet, it is confined to the A. densa woods.</p>
<p>At 10,500 feet, Saxifraga, two species on moist banks, A. densa woods,
small Umbellifera.</p>
<p>The sward commences at about 10,000 feet, and is common at 9,500
feet.&nbsp; It is clothed principally with the small bamboo noticed
in similar places above Sanah.&nbsp; Berberis spathulata commences.&nbsp;
It is with this sward that a new fir, with a larch-like look, which
I call temporarily Abies spinulosa, commences, and continues down to
the nullah, becoming more abundant as A. densa becomes less abundant,
and finally usurping its place entirely.&nbsp; Rhododendron microphyllum
continues to 9,600 feet, at which point Baptisoidea commences.</p>
<p>The vegetation hence to Bhoomlungtung consists entirely of Abies
spinulosa, intermixed with a species very like Abies pendula, this appears
at about 9,500 feet.&nbsp; The sward consists of small grasses, Juncus
niveus, Gnaphalium, Hypericum of Mollong, suffrutex incertus.&nbsp;
Juncus effusus at 9,000 feet, with Prinsepia utilis.</p>
<p>The marked indicators of great elevation are A. densa, Polygonum,
Rheum! Eriogona! Rhododendron microphyllum, ellipticum, and ellipticum
foliis basi cordatis, Epilobium, Triticoides, Holcoides, Umbellifera
of Royle, Saxifrag&aelig;, Ribes, Juniperus.</p>
<p>The most marked peculiarity is the comparative absence of A. densa
on the east side of the mountain, and its excessive abundance on the
west.&nbsp; This valley may be justly called the valley of pines, for
in no direction is any forest to be seen but those composed of pines.&nbsp;
The change indeed is extraordinary, in other respects as indicated by
the presence of a new Rosa and Prinsepia utilis.&nbsp; Another peculiarity
is the appearance for the first time of A. spinulosa.&nbsp; The range
of which is between 8 to 10,000 feet; this is a beautiful tree, and
disposed in beautiful groups.&nbsp; The valley altogether is a beautiful
one, and actually repays one for the trouble endured in getting access
to it.</p>
<p>The temperature in crossing the ridge was below that on Dhonglaila,
and below the freezing point at times.&nbsp; No inconvenience was felt
by us from the elevation, but many of our servants suffered probably
as much from fright as cold.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>27th</i>.&mdash;Halted.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>28th</i>.&mdash;This valley is certainly the prettiest
place we have yet seen, the left bank is particularly level, but neither
are of much breadth, the hills adjacent present rounded grassy patches,
interspersed with beautiful groves of pines.&nbsp; The level space,
as well as the more favourable sites on the slopes of the hills, are
occupied by wheat cultivation, which is carried on in a more workman-like
manner, than any of the previous cultivation I have hitherto seen.&nbsp;
The fields are occasionally surrounded with stone walls, but generally
only protected from the inroads of cattle by branches of thorny shrubs
strewed on their edges.&nbsp; They are kept clean, and above all, manure
is used: it is however dry and of a poor quality, apparently formed
of animal and vegetable moulds.&nbsp; In some of the fields the surface
is kept very fine, all stones and clods being carefully removed and
piled up in various parts of the field, but whether these masses are
again strewed over the ground.&nbsp; The plough is used, and penetrates
to about four inches.&nbsp; Hoes and rakes are also used, but the angle
of the handle is much too acute.&nbsp; Radishes are grown with the wheat:
no rice is cultivated here.</p>
<p>The village Bhoomlungtung, at which we are stationed is on the left
bank of a branch of the Bhoomla nullah, a river of some size, but fordable
in most places, its bed being subdivided.&nbsp; It is 8,668 feet above
the sea.&nbsp; The houses are ordinary, but they are surrounded with
stone walls.&nbsp; Our&rsquo;s, which is a portion of the Dhumpas or
headman&rsquo;s, has a court-yard, surrounded by a stone wall, and the
entrance is defended by a stout and large door.&nbsp; The natives invariably
wear dark clothing, the colour being only rivalled by that of their
skins, for I never saw dirtier people.&nbsp; The Bhooteas hitherto visited,
were quite paragons of cleanliness compared to those we are now among.&nbsp;
Half ruined villages are visible here and there, although otherwise
the appearance of the valley is prosperous enough.&nbsp; The valley
is surrounded on all sides by hills of great altitude, the lowest being
10,500 feet high.&nbsp; Snow is plentiful on the ridges, but it does
not remain long below, although falls are frequent.&nbsp; No fish are
to be seen in the river, which is otherwise as regards appearance as
beautiful a trout stream as one could wish to have.&nbsp; The birds
are the common sparrow, field-fare, red-legged crow, magpie, skylark,
a finch which flies about in large flocks, with a sub-forked tail, raven,
red-tailed stonechat, larger tomtit, syras, long-tailed duck, and quail,
which is much larger than that found in Assam.&nbsp; The woods are composed
entirely of Abies pendula, a few A. spinulosa occur, intermixed, but
the woods of the latter species are scarcely found below 9,500 feet.&nbsp;
The ridges are clothed with the columnar Abies densa.&nbsp; In thickets
a smaller Rosa, Rhododendron ellipticum, foliis basi cordatis, Rhododendron
elliptica, foliis subtus argenteis, Rhodod. gemmis viscosis.&nbsp; Berberis
asiatica, Hamamelidea? Bambusa microphyllum, Philadelphus, Thibaudia
orbicularis, Mespilus microphyllus, Taxus or Abies Brunonis, Ilex dipyrena,
occur.&nbsp; The sward shews small grasses, all past flower, Hemiphragma,
Thymus, Dipsacus, Juncus niveus, Gnaphalia 2, 3, Potentilla.</p>
<p>The fields have Crucifera Lamium and Verbascum, a late biennial species,
Caule simplici, Hemiphragma.</p>
<p>The marshy spots abound with Juncus effusus, and shew also a Primula
out of flower, and a Xyris past flowering.</p>
<p>Along the bed of the river, Hippoph&aelig; is the most common plant.&nbsp;
Lastly, a few trees occur of Q. ilecifolia, which assumes a very handsome
character, looking much like a Conifera at some distance, one group
occurs near the village, and a solitary tree or two elsewhere.&nbsp;
The other woody vegetables are Rosa fructibus hispidis, Cycnium, Pomacea
arbuscula, and one or two other deciduous shrubs.&nbsp; The willow tree
is also common.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Marched to Byagur, we were told that
the march was a short one, and that we should continue throughout along
the Bhoomlungtung river, which is called Tung-chiew.&nbsp; We did keep
along this for about two miles, when we struck off into the hills passing
through a village, we continued rising for perhaps 1,000 feet, when
we descended to a small nullah.&nbsp; Leaving this we commenced an ascent,
and a very long one too, and continued to ascend until we surmounted
the ridge overlooking the river, on which Byagur or Iugur is situated.&nbsp;
To the place we descended, the march was fourteen miles, direction westerly.&nbsp;
Highest ground traversed about 9,500 feet high.&nbsp; Road throughout
winding round and up hills, through woods of Abies pendula: nothing
of interest occurred.&nbsp; Magpies, crows, chatterer feeding on pine
cones, common in woods at 9,000 feet.&nbsp; Passed two or three villages,
all containing ruined houses.&nbsp; Direction we pursued was that of
the Tung-chiew river, until we reached the ridge guiding the Byagur
river to it: their junction takes place two or three miles below this
place, Cycnium occurred on the road in plenty, also Sarcococea.</p>
<p>Horseshoe curlew, the same as we shot at Daimara, common in the Tung-chiew,
along which the chief shrubs are Hippoph&aelig; and El&aelig;agnus,
particularly in the islets which are not uncommon in its bed.&nbsp;
The common water wagtail also occurs.</p>
<p>I find that the root of the common Potentilla is used here, as about
Nunklow, as a substitute for <i>sooparee</i>, it is unpleasantly astringent.&nbsp;
Observed Rhododendron microphylla on the loftier ground; very high land,
18,000 feet visible to the south along the course of Tung-chiew, covered
with heavy snow: Abies pendula is occasionally a beautiful tree, 100
feet high, and in appearance something like a cedar, the finest occurs
at a monastery under a bluff rock, about one and a half mile from Bhoomlungtung
on the Tung-chiew; Daphne papyrifer&aelig; occurred at 9,000 feet.&nbsp;
The heaps of earth piled up in the fields before sowing, consist of
burnt rubbish, the ashes are subsequently spread out.&nbsp; The manure
consists entirely of vegetables: here I find that the pine leaves are
piled up, and formed into manure by fermentation.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Byagur, the Soobah&rsquo;s house is
about 500 feet above us, and is a huge rambling edifice.&nbsp; We are
in a village situated in a rather capacious valley, percolated by a
large river, twice the size of the Tung-chiew, which is crossed by an
ordinary bridge, the river runs close to the hills, which form the left
bank, the right is a sort of plain, occupied by wheat cultivation, and
which has apparently at a former period, been the bed of the river.&nbsp;
In this valley other villages are visible, but they are small, and nothing
indicates either fertility or prosperity.&nbsp; The valley is surrounded
on all sides by high mountains, those towards Bhoomlungtung being lowest.&nbsp;
To the north-east very high land is visible.&nbsp; The ridge which separates
us from Tongse is, in the highest parts, certainly 12,000 feet, and
covered with snow.&nbsp; The people are dirty to an excess.</p>
<p>Crow, sparrow, Alauda, are the birds here.&nbsp; Saw a fox, an animal
of some size, with a beautiful brush.&nbsp; The botany is poor, the
hills are clothed with the usual grasses, abundance of Abies pendula.&nbsp;
The khets or fields present the old Lamium and Crucifera.&nbsp; The
only trees are one of Q. ilecifolia, and one or two of Salix lanata.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Cycnium is found here, but is put
to no use.&nbsp; The crops which are now springing up are very poor,
the soil being extremely bad, they are irrigated by means of canals,
but terraces are not in use, the ground being too level, the embankments
are much smaller than those used in rice cultivation.</p>
<p>The place is bleak in the extreme, and here, as often on the western
face of the Himalaya, at this season a fierce diurnal wind rises directly
the sun gets power, which always blows up the ravines or against the
streams draining these, it dies away towards evening, generally.&nbsp;
It is cold in the extreme, and must check vegetation extremely.&nbsp;
Syras, common here, as at Bhoomlungtung.</p>
<p>The ridge above this which is crossed coming from Bhoomlungtung,
is 9,947 feet high, yet no snow was on the ground.&nbsp; The contrast
between it and P&egrave;mee in regard to snow and vegetation is remarkable;
there the woods were thick, luxuriant, and varied, here nothing is to
be seen but Abies pendula.&nbsp; I consider this a proof that A. pendula
is a native of places below much snow, and that where snow abounds,
it will not be found to extend above 8,000 feet.&nbsp; The dwarf bamboo
of Sanah is common here, covering large patches of ground, Lamium of
Bulphai in the vicinity of temples, and enclosing pagodas.&nbsp; The
people here evince great skill in figures, but none in architecture.</p>
<p>The Soobah&rsquo;s house, a castellated heterogeneous mansion, spread
over much ground, the defences on one side reaching nearly to the level
of the valley.&nbsp; The Kumpa dogs are fierce and handsome, with the
bark of a mastiff, they are not apparently deterred by threats, but
rather the contrary.&nbsp; A woman with dropsy, wrapped in filthy clothes,
presented herself and evinced great anxiety to have her pulse felt,
but the dirt of her clothes was such, that I made excuses.</p>
<p>Manure for the land consists of pine leaves, etc. mixed with cow-dung.&nbsp;
The cattle are well littered; and grass is here of rather better description:
all cattle are however in wretched condition notwithstanding, and the
cows give very little milk.&nbsp; The houses of the poorer orders, are
unornamented, but those of the better classes are always ornamented
with a belt of red ochre outside.&nbsp; There are no large boulders
in the river here, although it runs with violence.&nbsp; This is owing
to the softness or tenacity of the rocks.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Our march commenced with a steep ascent
up the ridge, forming the west boundary of the valley, surmounting this
we proceeded on for some distance at about the same level, and thence
descended rapidly to a nullah.&nbsp; We then ascended slightly, and
subsequently descended to the valley, in which the village Jaisa is
situated.&nbsp; The distance was nine miles; the march was pretty, almost
entirely through fir woods, three villages were visible in a valley
to the left, which is in fact the termination of the Jaisa one, but
beyond the valleys no cultivation whatever was visible.</p>
<p>The first part was up a barren grassy slope, after which we entered
fir woods, these at first were almost entirely constituted of Abies
pendula.</p>
<p>At 9,000 feet Chimaphila, Berberis spathulata, Abies pendula, Bambusa
microphylla of Sanah, Mespilus microphyllus, Rhododendron elliptica,
foliis basi cordatis subtus argenteis, Philadelphus Lycopod. of Surureem,
Gaultheria nummularifolia, Rhododendron viscosum.</p>
<p>At 9,300 feet, Abies spinulosa becomes more common, Rosa hispida
and microphylla! Pinus cedroides commences, Dalibarda, Daphne papyracea,
Thymus, Gnaphalia, Mespilus and Berberis, as before, Potentilla.</p>
<p>At 9,500 feet, snow lying on the path in sheltered places, Euphorbia,
Gaultheria arboreoides, Hypnum rubescens, scolopendrioids, Pteris aquilina,
Melianthus, Rosa, frutex erectus ramis hispidissimis, ramulis subglabratis,
fructibus pendulis glabris, tubo-ovato, sepalis lanceolatis.&nbsp; Salix
arbuscula, gemmis rubur glabris, foliis lanceolatis subtus glaucis,
amentis f&aelig;minies pendulis, Bupleurum, Hydrangea, Spir&aelig;a
densa belloides! Prunella, Pinus cedroides common at Potentilla.</p>
<p>At 9,700, 9,800, to 10,000 feet, Abies densa, a few trees, as usual
many blasted, from lightning confined entirely towards the summit, Acer
sterculiacea, Aruncus, Thibaudia orbicularis, A. spinulosa very common,
A. pendula ceases, or at most only stunted plants occur, Mespilus microphyllus,
Berberis spathulata, Baptisia, these were very common on west face,
which is level enough and open.</p>
<p>Here also Pedicularis, Bupleurum, stunted Pteris aquilina, Polygonum,
Rheum! Avena! Pendulous lichens luxuriant.&nbsp; Along the level tracts,
the woods consisted entirely of Abies spinulosa, a minute Gentiana common
on the sward.</p>
<p>The descent was steep to the ravine; half-way down A. pendula commenced
to flourish, and towards the ravine it was more common than A. spinulosa;
Rhododendron microphyllum was seen on this face at 9,500 feet, Verbascum
at 9,200 feet, but most of the plants seen on the east face were not
found on this.&nbsp; Acer sterculiacea, however occurred at 9,800 feet,
otherwise pines were the most prominent feature.</p>
<p>At the nullah, Dipsacus, El&aelig;agnus, Salix lanata, Artemisia
major, Daphne papyracea, Rhododendron viscosum, Mespilus microphyllus,
Rosa hispida, spinus acutissimis, Bambusa of Sanah, Plectranthus a large
suffruticose annual species, common in all the same altitudes, were
observed.&nbsp; The subsequent descent was through woods of A. pendula,
with a few of A. spinulosa intermixed.</p>
<p>The limits of A. densa, A. spinulosa and A. pendula, Melianthus,
Acer sterculiacea, Thibaudia orbicularis, A. cedroides, Rosa microphylla,
Pedicularis, Hydrangea, Baptisia, Berberis spathulata were well determined.&nbsp;
They may be expressed as follows: A. densa, 10 to 13,000 feet, A. spinulosa,
9 to 10,500 feet, A. pendula, 6 to 9,000 feet, Melanthus, 9,500 feet,
Acer sterculiaceum, 9,800 to 10,000 feet, Thibaudia orbicularis, 10,000
feet, A. cedroides, 9,000 to 9,800 feet, Rosa microphylla, 9,800 to
13,000 feet, Pedicularis, 10 to 12,500 feet, Hydrangea, 4 to 10,000
feet unless two species are confounded, Baptisia, 9 to 9,800 feet, Berberis
spathulata, 9 to 10,000 feet.</p>
<p><i>Jaisa</i> is a good sized village for Bootan, and the houses are
rather large.&nbsp; We were lodged in the castle, a large building,
with a capacious flagged court-yard, surrounded by galleries: we were
housed in the grand floor of the higher portion fronting the gate.&nbsp;
A good deal of wheat cultivation occurs around.&nbsp; The village is
situated in a small nullah, surrounded on all sides by pine-clad hills.&nbsp;
The vegetation is precisely the same as at Juggur, with the exception
of a Ligustrum, which is common along the nullah.&nbsp; Larks, red-legged
crows and ravens, abound here.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Our march consisted of a progress
along levelish ground up the river, occasionally rounding small eminences:
we then commenced the ascent of a ridge, the summit of which we reached
about half past-twelve.&nbsp; Snow is common above 9,000 feet.&nbsp;
The descent was steep and uninterrupted from about 2,000 feet, when
we reached a small river.&nbsp; Thence we ascended a little to descend
again, we continued over a ravine at nearly the same level, for some
time proceeding over undulated ground: on reaching the debouchure of
the ravine into a larger one running north and south, we commenced to
descend rapidly until we came to an elevation situated above Tongsa,
to this place the descent was excessively steep.&nbsp; The march was
thirteen miles long, the direction west.</p>
<p>At a temple near Jaisa found the Juniper of Oongar in flower, and
arboreous, attaining a height of about 40 feet.&nbsp; The whole march
up, nearly to the summit, was through pine woods, A. pendula and spinulosa
being intermixed for some time.&nbsp; I noticed Primula globifera, Eucalypta,
Thibaudia orbicularis, Aruncus, Rosa ramis hispidis, Dipsacus, Prunella,
Potentilla, Gnaphalium, Sphagnum, Daphne papyracea, Tofieldia, Gaultheria
nummularoides, as we approached the base of the ridge or rather the
spot at which the ascent commenced.&nbsp; At this place Abies cedroides
commenced, and Abies pendula became uncommon.</p>
<p>On a bank here, I gathered abundance of mosses, Bartramia, Dicrana,
etc. and some Jungermanni&aelig;.</p>
<p>The ascent was through precisely similar vegetation, in one place
it was exceedingly pretty, consisting of sward with pines.&nbsp; Here
snow was lying on the ground in sheltered places to the depth of several
inches.&nbsp; The ground hence was levelish, but between this place
and the summit a rise of a hundred feet took place.&nbsp; Between these
places Abies densa, cedroides and spinulosa, occurred, but this was
uncommon, Rosa ramis hispidis, Salix of yesterday, Bambusa of Sanah,
stunted Pteris aquilina, Betuloidea, Hydrangea, Hypnum rufescens, scolopendrioid
as well as below: Spir&aelig;a belloides, Rhododendron obovatum, which
varies on the same plant with ferruginous and white leaves, Sphagnum,
Thibaudia orbicularis.&nbsp; On sward Gentiana minima.</p>
<p>As the snow increased, Abies cedroides became less, Abies densa more
common.&nbsp; At the very summit Parnassia, Polygonum rheum, Composita
penduliflora, Rhododendron hispidum, Berberis spathulata, which had
occurred previously, Vaccinium pumilium, ciliatum, Gentiana minima,
Swertia, Cnicus, Composit&aelig; frequent, Labiata spicata of Dhonglaila.</p>
<p>The descent was at first open, through swardy places: here Acer sterculiaceum,
Geranium scandens, Avena, Abies densa, Juniperus fruticosa, raro arbuscula.</p>
<p>At 9,800 feet, Rhododendron foliis lanceolato-oblongis subtus ferruginea
tomentosis, arborea, became very common, forming large woods, Abies
densa interspersed, Juniperus, Betuloidea which has six or seven layers
of bark, the <i>boj</i>-<i>putah</i> of Hindoostan according to Blake,
Rosa microphylla, Hemiphragma, Daphne papyracea, Dicranum stratum, etc.</p>
<p>At 9,500 feet, Clematis, Berberis asiatica, commences, Betula, common
Andropogoneous grasses.</p>
<p>At 9,300 feet, Primula pulcherrima, Abies cedroides very common,

Gaultherium nummularifolia common, Rubia cordifolia! Hydrangea.</p>
<p>At 8,900 feet, Junipers cease, woods of Q. ilecifolia and Pinus cedroides,
Rosa microphylla, shrubby Rhododendrons, that which was arboreous previously
now becoming shrubby, Berberis asiatica, Taxus or Abies brunonis! Lomaria

Valeriana violifolia, Eurya acuminata, Daphne papyrifolia, Fragaria,
Potentilla supina, Rumex of Khegumpa, Poa annua, Stellaria media and

of Surureem, Ilex, Daphne papyrifer&aelig;, are the only elevational
plants found between 8 and 9,000 feet, and which continue low down.&nbsp;
All the others ceased with the jungles.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>13th</i>.&mdash;<i>Tongsa</i>: this, although the
second place in the kingdom, is a poor wretched village, the houses,
always excepting the palace, are poorer than ordinary, abounding in
rats, fleas, and other detestable vermin.&nbsp; Our reception would
seem to be uncordial: we are miserably housed in the heart of the village,
which is a beggarly one.&nbsp; On descending the hill some people in
the Pillo&rsquo;s house behaved very insolently, roaring out, and making
most insolent signs for me to dismount, of which of course I took no
notice: sparrow-hawk was seen at 8,000 feet.&nbsp; There is but little
cultivation, indeed the adjoining hills are barren in the extreme.&nbsp;
The little cultivation there is of barley, which is now in the ear,
and decent enough; the crops being much better than any we have yet
seen, although in many fields it is difficult to see any crop at all.&nbsp;
The village, including the houses on the surrounding adjoining heights
does not contain thirty houses.&nbsp; There is one flock of sheep, which
are in good condition, some small shawl-goats, and a few cattle, but
of a lighter breed than the Mithans, from which they are very distinct,
and which we have scarcely seen since crossing Dhonglaila, the first
high ridge.&nbsp; There is some rice cultivation along the nullah or
torrent, on which the village is situated.&nbsp; Pears, peaches likewise
occur, and are now both in flower.&nbsp; The hills around are bare,
nothing but shrubby vegetation being visible, the tree-jungle not descending
below 7,500 feet, except on one spur to the south-west, on which it
reaches nearly to our present level.</p>
<p>The shrubby vegetation consists of Hamamelid&aelig;, Salix, Gaultheria
fruticosa, Rosa, Rubus, Pomacea, El&aelig;agnus, Berberis asiatica,
among which Artemisia major occurs on sward.&nbsp; Primula Stuartii,
Potentilla and P. supina, Oxalis acetoseltoides, Juncus, Bartramia,
Polytrichum glaucum, Fragaria vesca.&nbsp; In the fields Lamium, Crucifera,
Thlaspi, Gnaphalium aureum, Prenanthoid, Fragaria indica, Viola, Ranunculus,
Oxalis acetosella, Poa annua.</p>
<p>Urtica urens, and urentior occur about the houses, Cupressus pendula
and a Magnoliaceous tree, with exquisitely fragrant blossoms.</p>
<p>The palace is a huge, long, straggling piece of patch-work, of ordinary
construction, and less imposing than that of Byagur, which the Pillo
makes his summer residence on the Bhoomlungtung; it is however ornamented
with three gilt umbrellas.&nbsp; It is situated on the bank of the nullah,
and defended by some outworks, 6 to 700 feet above it; to the east,
these might, from their situation, be easily demolished by stones.&nbsp;
The palace itself is commanded in every direction, particularly by the
hill, along which we came from Jaisa; indeed a person might jump from
the summit of this on to the outpost, and thence on to the palace; so
precipitous is the descent.</p>
<p>The people, above all those hitherto seen, are dirty in their persons,
uniting curiosity with no small share of obstinacy and impertinence
in their manners.&nbsp; The birds are the blackbird, a black mina, the
house-sparrow, sparrow-hawk, larger crow, domestic pigeons, kites, and
hoopoo.&nbsp; The red-legged crows I have heard once, but far above,
nor do I think that they ever visit this.&nbsp; The productions being
essentially different from those of the elevated valleys we have lately
quitted.&nbsp; Can those valleys be the <i>steps</i> to the table-land
of Thibet to which they must be near, and which is reached sooner in
that direction than any other?&nbsp; The idea of the high valleys in
question being steps to table-land is perhaps corroborated by the fact,
that the table-land is said to be within two days&rsquo; journey from
Byagur.</p>
<p>Our interview with the Pillo took place on the 15th, it was conducted
with some state, and with some impertinence.&nbsp; The latter was indicated
by delaying us at the door of the audience room, the former by the attendance
of more numerous and better dressed attendants than usual.&nbsp; Two
Pillos were present.&nbsp; The incense as usual was burning, and the
Pillos, both old and new, were seated before some large Chinese-looking
figures.&nbsp; The only novel ceremony was the praying over a mess of
something which I imagine was meant for tea; in the prayer all joined,
when finished the beverage was handed to the Pillos, who, however, were
contented with merely tasting it.&nbsp; Before this some was strewn
on the floor in front, and some to the right of the chieftains.&nbsp;
The castle was in places crowded with people, no less than 5 to 600,
but all were as dirty as usual.&nbsp; None but the immediate attendants
appeared armed.&nbsp; The new Pillo is a dark low-looking man, with
an incipient goitre, the old one a more decent aristocratic looking
person, good-looking and very fair.&nbsp; The presents were of course
beggarly, consisting of indifferent oranges, wretched plantains, sugarcane
of still worse quality, and ghee of an abominable odour.</p>
<p>March 17th.&mdash;We still remain here, and do not expect to leave
for two or three days.&nbsp; The weather is unsettled, and the sun increasing
in power daily.&nbsp; The new Soobahs left to-day for their appointments,
with the exception of the Dewangur one.&nbsp; Pigs are here fed on boiled
nettle leaves: old ladies may be seen occasionally busily employed in
picking the leaves for this purpose, and which they do by means of bamboo
pincers or tweezers.&nbsp; A few plantains may be met with here, but
in a wretched state.&nbsp; Rice may be seen 500 feet above this, on
the north of the castle, the slope of a hill being appropriated to its
cultivation; the terraces above, owing to the inclination, are very
narrow, and from the paucity of straw, the crops must, I should infer,
be very poor.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>22nd</i>.&mdash;To-day we took our leave of the Pillo,
who received us in a room to the south of the castle.&nbsp; He was friendly
enough, but begged for presents unconscionably.&nbsp; He was surrounded
by a considerable number of more mean-looking persons than ordinary.&nbsp;
On the previous meeting he talked openly of being at enmity with the
present Deb Rajah, but on this occasion he said little on the subject.</p>
<p>The castle is an ill-built, and worse arranged building, the windows
and loopholes being so placed as to afford every facility for shooting
into the air.&nbsp; In a court-yard, several tiger skins brought from
the plains, are suspended.</p>
<p>It now appears that this Pillo, who said previously that the new
Deb was never installed, is himself an usurper, previously handing the
old Deb from the throne.&nbsp; This latter personage appears to be by
far the more popular of the two.&nbsp; The Pillo must now have great
influence, as all the posts in his division, are either held by his
own sons, or by his more influential servants.&nbsp; The sons by the
bye are, so long as they remain in the presence, treated like ordinary
servants.&nbsp; Joongar is held by one of his sons, a lad of about eighteen,
of plain but pleasing appearance and of good manners.&nbsp; He visited
us yesterday, and his newly acquired rank sat easily on him.&nbsp; The
old Pillo no doubt owes his rank to his having been the father of the
lad chosen to be Dhurma Rajah, he is himself very evidently low-born
and low-bred, and compared with the former one, so poor a specimen,
that the greater popularity of the former is not to be wondered at.&nbsp;
From all we have heard, they are contemptible rulers, as they appear
to do nothing but intrigue for power among themselves.&nbsp; Changes
are hence excessively frequent, and were they attended with much bloodshed,
the country would be depopulated.</p>
<p>This evening we had ample proof that the Bhootea houses are not water-proof.&nbsp;
Heavy showers occurred with thunder and dense clouds from the south-west.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;We left Tongsa, proceeding through
the castle, and thence struck down to the river Mateesun.&nbsp; The
descent was very steep, and amounted to about 1,200 feet.&nbsp; The
river is crossed by an ordinary bridge, it is a large and violent stream
and contains fish, some of which, seen by Blake, were of large size.&nbsp;
Crossing this, we continued throughout the remainder of the march, gradually
rising along the ridges bounding the Tongsa river.&nbsp; We continued
rising until we reached our halting place, Taseeling.&nbsp; In one or
two places, the road was completely built up; ascending by zig-zags
up, in some degree, perpendicular cliffs.&nbsp; The distance was seven
miles.</p>
<p>Proceeding to the bridge, observed Rubus deltoideus, Pomacea, Quercus
tomentosa, Artemisia major, Cycnium, Gaultheria arborea and fruticosa,
Buddl&aelig;a, Quercus altera, Indigofera cana, Gaylussacia serratoides,
Hedera, Thibaudia myrtifolia, Pomacea sauraugifolia, Viburnum c&aelig;rulescens,
Quercus robur budding, Pterogonium, Fragaria, Duchesnia.</p>
<p>The remaining hills were much similar, generally very bare, clothed
with partial woods of Q. tomentosa, Rhododendron minus; the oak changing
to Q. robur, as we increased our elevation.&nbsp; Near the bridge noticed
Bucklandia, Erythrina, which is likewise found at Tongsa, M&aelig;sa

here a tree, occasionally but small, Erythroxyloides, Conyza nivea and
communis, Gleichenia major, Parochetus communis on wet dripping rocks,

being supplied by Q. robur, Verbascum, Juncus, Gaultheria nummularioid,
Mespilus microphyllus, Scirpus fuscus of Tassangsee, Thibaudia gaultherifolia,
Rubia cordifolia, Azalea, and Daphne capitulis pendulis, Ranunculus
uniflorus, Hydroctyle.</p>
<p>Taseeling is situated about 2,000 feet above the Mateesun, on a nakedish
hill; about it there is some cultivation, and one or two villages, one
towards Tongsa and above Taseeling of some size.&nbsp; The place itself
consists of a large house, with some fine specimens of Cypressus pendula,
the east face of the house has the red stripe, indicative of rank.&nbsp;
Its elevation is about 7,300 feet, close to the house I observed the
Lamium of Bulphai, Bursa pastoris, Oxalis corniculata, Cnicus out of
flower, Artemisia major, Fragaria vesca, Daphne pendula and papyracea,
Hemiphragma, Composita pendulifolia, Lycopod. of Surureem, Hypericum,
Berberis asiatica, Juniperus; Barley cultivation, and a Pomaceous arbuscula,
armat. ovar. 5-discretis.&nbsp; The red-legged crow occurs here, and
a thrush much resembling our English one.&nbsp; The raven of course
occurs.&nbsp; A curious opening occurs in the hills at Taseeling, affording
a prospect of the Bag Dooar plains, seven days&rsquo; journey distant,
but the road is bad.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Leaving Taseeling we commenced to
ascend until we rounded a ridge, when we turned to the west, we then
commenced to descend, but slightly, winding over undulated surfaces
of barrenish hills.&nbsp; After some time we reached heavy tree jungle,
the road proceeding in the same undulating manner, so that it was impossible
to say whether we had risen or descended.&nbsp; About one we came on
the river, up the ravine of which we had been advancing ever since turning
to the west.&nbsp; This stream is of some size, very violent and rapid,
but fordable.&nbsp; Near this is a large pagoda, built after the old
Boodhistical style, and the only respectable one we have yet seen, its
site is pretty, and it is ornamented above with eyes and a fiery-red
nose.&nbsp; Leaving this we ascended along one bank of the river, until
we reached Chindupjee, our halting place; this was distant from the
pagoda three miles, and from Taseeling twelve.&nbsp; This latter part
reminded me of Bhoomlungtung; firs being the prevailing trees, and the
valley having more pretensions to the name than usually happens.</p>
<p>We encamped in a beautiful spot, the house being situated on fine
sloping sward, surrounded by picturesque trees of Q. ilecifolia, a few
tall Cypressus standing up in the centre.&nbsp; The village is a few
feet above, and of average size, although it looks from a little distance
to be of considerable size.&nbsp; The march throughout was beautiful,
especially after entering the wooded tract; this reminded me of the
march near Khegumpa, the woods were here and there very picturesque,
glades and swards abounding, water was very abundant here, and this
no doubt causes the development of so much vegetation.</p>
<p>At 7,800 feet, Thibaudiace&aelig; very common, Rhododendron two species,
Gaultheria flexuosoides, Thibaudia obovata, Caudata myrtifolia, Hydrangea,
which I find to be a climber, Rhododendron majus, commencing, pine wood;
chatterers heard here.&nbsp; Hills naked or covered here and there with
stunted wood; marshy places common.</p>
<p>At 7,600 feet, Lomaria of Khegumpa, Tetranthera nuda, Sph&aelig;ropteris,
pear and apple, Q. tomentosa, Magnolia grandiflora begins, Polygonum
rheoides, Daphne pendula, which is used, as well as the other, both
here and in Nepal in the manufacture of paper: brick-red black-pate.</p>
<p>At this same elevation farther on, Rosa hispida! Gillenia, Juncus,
Rhododendron deflexa, Smilax gaultherifolia, Spir&aelig;a bella, Dipsacus,
Spir&aelig;a decomposita, Ilex, Vaccinium cyaneum, Magnolia grandiflora
very common.&nbsp; The country now becomes more wooded, the woods being
confined to moist ravines, and in other situations where water is very
plentiful, the woods throughout become continuous, and forming the large
forests before mentioned: having the open spaces between the woods covered
with sward, on which Gentiana pygm&aelig;a, and Fragaria are very common.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As we approached the wood or forest, Pinus cedroides commenced, and
towards the valley of Chindupjee this species became very common, Rumex
occurred throughout in wet places, also at Taseeling.&nbsp; Geranium
is common also in wet places, Stauntonia latifolia, Potentilla, Duchesnoides,
Tussilago of Churra, on the confines of wood and on it.&nbsp; Here the
orange breasted trochilus occurred.&nbsp; The mass of the wood is formed
of a fine Quercus, resembling Q. glauca, it is a beautiful and a shady
tree.&nbsp; Next to it in abundance is Rhododendron majus, now in full
flower, and forming a beautiful object, Rhododendron minus ceases with
the barrener tracts.&nbsp; Magnolia is very conspicuous; Pinus cedroides
common towards the pagoda; Eurya not rare, Gaultheria nummulifolia continues
throughout, Valeriana violifolia, Oxalis acetoselloides, Bryum, Butia
purpurea, Sambucus, Saxifraga of Bulphai, and another species, Bambusa
microphylla, Swertia, Luzula, Thibaudia orbicularis, Primula Stuartii,
occurred between the commencement of the ascent and the pagoda; at between
7,300 to 7,600 feet, Magnolia odoratis.</p>
<p>At the pagoda and village, Pinus cedroides, P. pendula, Bambusa of
Sanah, Mespilus microphyllus, Magnolia grandiflora, Berberis asiatica,
Q. anthoxylia, Coriaria, Rosa altera of Bhoomlungtung, El&aelig;agnus,
Salix and Allium of Bulphai, occur.</p>
<p>Chindupjee is situated on a rivulet close to the confluence, with
a larger stream.&nbsp; Around it, or at least between the village and
the larger stream, picturesque patches of sward bordered with a very
picturesque oak.&nbsp; Q. ilecifolia occur; this tree predominates all
about the village, it is certainly the prettiest place we have yet seen.</p>
<p>Some cultivation occurs around, chiefly of barley, with a little
portion of radishes.&nbsp; The valley is surrounded by comparatively
low mountains, most of which are rather bare, many are transversely
furrowed on the surface, this may arise from their having been at some
former period under cultivation.&mdash;The prevailing trees on the surrounding
heights are firs, Pinus pendula and cedroides.&nbsp; No fish are to
be seen in the river.&nbsp; The birds are the raven, white-necked starling,
<i>bullfinch</i>, crimson and yellow shrikelets, blue tomtits, lesser
ditto with two stripes on the head, white-rumped waterchat, red-tailed
chesnuty sparrow.</p>
<p>The plants are Q. ilecifolia, Magnolia grandiflora, Laurinea, Hamamelidioides,
Castanea aromatica, Pinus cedroides and pendula, Bambusa microphylla,
and B. of Sanah which may be a variety depending on its marshy sites,
Rhododendron minus, Salix, Mespilus microphyllus, Gaultheria nummularoides,
El&aelig;agnus, Marchantia, Swertia, Rumex, Daphne papyracea, Dipsacus,
Artemisia major, Berberis asiatica, Rosa hispida, Rubus c&aelig;sius,
Stauntonia latifolia, Tofieldioid of Sanah and Pemee, Taxus, Mespilus
microphyllus, Ilex dipyrena, Oxalis acetoselloid, Thymus, Lycopodium
of Surureem, Juniperus.</p>
<p>Bamboos split and inverted, and then placed in the ground, are used
to scare away beasts from the cornfields.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>26th</i>.&mdash;Left at seven and a half and proceeded
along the river which runs by Chindupjee, the path running over the
spurs of the hills, forming its right bank.&nbsp; After proceeding about
four miles, we crossed the nullah, changing our direction, and proceeding
up a tributary, until we reached a prettily situated, and rather large
village, thence we commenced to ascend over naked slopes with intervening
woods, until we reached the base of the chief ascent, which is not very
steep, although of good length, chiefly over naked hills.&nbsp; On reaching
the summit, which is about 10,000 feet high, we commenced to descend,
and the descent continued uninterruptedly and steeply until we reached
Rydang, where we halted.</p>
<p>We passed only one village, which is about five miles from Chindupjee,
and of similar size; but we passed in the more elevated places two temporary
ones, apparently intended for the residence of the herdsmen of y&acirc;ks
or chowry-tailed cows, as a herd of these animals was seen feeding near
each place.</p>
<p>The march throughout was beautiful, in the more elevated and drier
portions, winding over swardy slopes or through woods of fir trees:
on the descent from 9,000 feet downwards, passing through beautiful
forests, chiefly of oak, and diversified in every possible way.&nbsp;
The long-tailed pie was met with in the first portion, about 7,800 feet,
the speckled chatterers at 8,500 feet, red shrikelet at 7,800 feet,
and a new hawk at 8,300 feet.&nbsp; I observed the water-ouzel again
as high as 8,000 feet.&nbsp; The new plants were a Carex, 6,500 feet,
a sileneous plant past flowering, from the <i>same</i> limestone formation.</p>
<p>At 7,800 feet, and not far from Chindupjee, Pinus spinulosa again
re-appears, it becomes common towards the village alluded to, and continues
throughout the ascent, up to 9,300 feet, P. cedroides was uncommon during
the first part of the march, its place being occupied by P. spinulosa,
afterwards it re-appeared, and continued abundant up to 9,300 feet,
it re-appeared on the descent about the same elevation, and continued
to about 8,000 feet.&nbsp; Abies densa commences at the base of the
chief ascent: at 10,000 feet, it is the only fir to be seen, it descends
but a short way on the Rydang side.&nbsp; In the higher portions it
occurred mixed with a Juniper, which in proper places becomes a small
but elegant tree.</p>
<p>At the village on 7,000 feet, observed Rosa hispida, Ligustram of
Jaisa, Philadelphus, Pinus spinulosa common, as also Pinus cedroides,

Salix as before, Artemisia major, Rumex, Valeriana violifolia, Rosa,
Berberis asiatica, Ervicia crucifera, Thlaspi, Callitriche, Calamus.</p>
<p>The curious features are, the absence of Thibaudia obovata on the
descent, and of Mespilus microphyllus, the substitution of Thibaudia
orbicularis, and its low descent, the abundance of Taxus, size of the
cedar and Q. ilecifolia, the re-appearance at same elevation of Magnolia
grandiflora, occurrence of Rubia cordifolia, at such an elevation, etc.</p>
<p><i>Rydang</i> is prettily situated towards the bottom of a rather

<p><i>March</i> <i>27th</i>.&mdash;Our march commenced with a steep
descent to the Gnee, a river of average size.&nbsp; We then continued
descending along it for some time, crossing it once on our way: we then
diverged up a small nullah, and then commenced a very steep ascent,
of about 2,000 feet.&nbsp; After attaining this, we proceeded through
woods, or over sward at about the same elevation, still continuing along
the Gnee.&nbsp; We subsequently commenced to descend at first through
fine oak woods, then over barren naked hills.&nbsp; We reached Santagoung,
about three and a half miles distance in a direct line, but fourteen
miles by the road, highest point traversed 8,000 feet; lowest reached
6,000.</p>
<p>During first part of descent, noticed one or two straggling cedars
and Taxus, Primula Stuartii, the woods were formed by Quercus robur,
tomentosa, Gaultheria arborea, Rhododendron minus, Scabiosa reappears,
Clematis nova species, Sambucus, Rubus cresius, Composita pendulifolia,

<p>The remainder of the vegetation afforded little of interest; consisted
of stunted oaks, Q. tomentosa, Gaultheria arborea, Rhododendron minus:
Serissoides reappears near Santagoung, Pinus longifolia, plantains.</p>
<p>The valley to the left towards Santagoung is on the left side well
populated and cultivated.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>28th</i>.&mdash;Santagoung, a small village 6,300
feet above the sea, situated on bare hills, between two loftier ridges.&nbsp;
Country around well inhabited and well cultivated in the terrace style:
villages numerous.&nbsp; Pinus longifolia, Rosa, Azalea, etc. occur
here as before.&nbsp; A lake or jheel was observed 500 feet below the
village, of some extent, formed in a natural hollow, abounding with
Scirpus trigueter of Churra, and Hydropeltis.&nbsp; Water-fowl, snipe,
and red pie-like peewit or plover.</p>
<p>The march commenced with a steep descent, which continued until we
reached the river.</p>
<p>Crossing this we ascended 1,000 feet, and then proceeded in an undulating
manner over naked hills until we reached Thain, distance six miles;
the greatest descent was about 1,800 feet, ascent 1,000 feet; the country
naked; no forest.&nbsp; The hills for some extent towards Thain appeared
from some cause very red.</p>
<p>But little interesting vegetation occurred: noticed a huge Cypressus
pendula, half-way to the Gnee.&nbsp; Vegetation otherwise much the same
as towards Tassgong, Valeriana violifolia, Azalea, Campanula linearis,
Rubus deltoides, Aspidium macroser., Artemisia major, Pinus longifolia

descends so low?), Lerissoides, Osbeckia linearis, Euphorbia, Gordonia,
Gymnobotrys.&nbsp; Red-legged crow; in descent altitude 5,800 feet,
the most common plant is a species of Berberis very nearly allied to

<p>Blackbird, sparrow-hawk, and Hoopoe about houses; it has a curious
hoop, varied with a grating chirp.</p>
<p>The blackbird frequents houses here; its voice is very discordant
and singular, sparrow-hawks were seen to pursue wounded pigeons.&nbsp;
Houses few, built of unbaked and large bricks or rather cakes of mud.&nbsp;
The village of Wandipore is visible to the south-west, about one and
a half mile.&nbsp; Snow on ridges to west, all which are lofty.&nbsp;
The country around Wandipore is tolerably populous, though not so much
so as about Santagoung.</p>
<p>We were compelled to halt at Phain or Thain, until the 1st instant,
owing to the admirable management of the Bhooteas.&nbsp; It appeared
at first as if the Zoompoor or Governor of Wandipore was determined
that we should not be gainers in time by not going through his castle,
but subsequently it turned out that the Deb had, with infinite consideration,
wished us to remain in order to rest ourselves after our long journey.&nbsp;
This may have been merely said to shelter the Wandipore man, who had
the impudence to send one evening to us saying, that the Deb and Durmah
were coming to Wandipore next morning, and that we were to meet them
there, and return the same evening to Punukha.&nbsp; This turned out
untrue.&nbsp; Pemberton was at last compelled to write to the Deb, and
the consequence was the arrangement for our advance next morning.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;The march to Punukha extended over
a most barren dried-up country, the features presented were the same
as those about Phain.&nbsp; We proceeded at first in the direction of
Wandipore, then diverged, proceeding downwards in the direction of the
villages.&nbsp; The remainder of our journey extended either just above
the base of the hills, or along the valley: the distance was nine miles.&nbsp;
The march was an uninteresting one; the only pretty part being the river
that drains the valley, and it is one of considerable size, fordable
in but few places; the rapids are frequent, but the intermediate parts
flow gently.&nbsp; We were all dreadfully disappointed in the capital,
the castle even is by no means so imposing as that of Tongsa or Byagur;
the city miserable, consisting of a few mean houses, and about as many
ruined ones.</p>
<p>The surrounding cultivation is chiefly poor wheat; the hills the
most barren conceivable.&nbsp; On arriving near the palace we made a
detour, to avoid exposure to the usual regal insolence: our plan was
effectual.&nbsp; From some distance I had espied our quarters, and although
our mission is one sent by the most powerful eastern government, yet
we had allotted to us a residence fit only for hogs.</p>
<p>It consisted of a court-yard, surrounded by walls, and what had evidently
been stabling; the apartments were numerous, but excessively small,
the roof of single mats.&nbsp; The place swarmed with vermin.&nbsp;
In this we determined not to stay, and so proceeded to the city, (for
sure there cannot be a capital without a city,) and there, after some
delay, procured two houses, in one of which the present Tongso Pillo
had lodged before his present exaltation.&nbsp; But imagine not that
it was a palace.&nbsp; The two houses together furnished three habitable
rooms.</p>
<p>I imagine not that the houses were procured for us by the local government.&nbsp;
We only obtained them by Pemberton&rsquo;s liberality was well known.&nbsp;
The Sepoys&rsquo; lines were transported hither not by Bhooteas but
by our own people.&nbsp; In addition the people are in many cases insolent,
and it was only after a peremptory message to the Deb, stating what
the consequences would be of such a system of annoyance, that we got
any assistance.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;We have heard nothing of the Mutaguat.&nbsp;
It appears that the country is unsettled now.&nbsp; The old Deb having
possession of Tassisudon, and the people here declaring they will stop
all supplies if the Deb does not, according to custom, repair at the
usual period to Tassisudon.&nbsp; A Deewan here, who has held office
under four Rajahs, says, that the present truce is owing to the hot
weather; Bhooteas only admire fighting in the cold season, in conformation
of which, he says that in the cold season the contest will be renewed.&nbsp;
There will then be an additional bone of contention for the present.&nbsp;
Nor should I much wonder if the Paro Pillo then comes forward and takes
the Debship and all away.&nbsp; The Deewan&rsquo;s account of the past
fighting, places the Bhooteas in a most contemptible light: it appears
that when they fire a gun, they take no aim, their only aim being to
place their bodies as far as possible from the weapon; the deadly discharge
is followed up by the deadlier discharge of a stone.&nbsp; At plunder
they are more adroit.</p>
<p>The following plants may be found about this place; Ligustrum, Salex
pendula, Valeriana orolifolia, Campanula linearis, senecionide&aelig;,
Viola, Jasminum, Rosea, Conaria, mangoe one tree in the gardens, Citrus
two or three species in ditto, Jubrung, Diospyros, Acorus, Veronica,
Ranunculus, Sclerossophalos, Alopecercus, Agrostides, Bombax, stunted
weeping cypress, Pinus longifolia, Punica, Dipsacus, Potentilla, Potamogeton
2, Hypericum japonica, Lysimachia, Chenopod, Ajuga, Anisomales.</p>
<p>Birds&mdash;great kingfisher, diver snappet, white-pated rumped chats,
no ouzels.&nbsp; Part of the gardens extend from the palace up the river
to the village; the breadth is fifty to seventy yards, the length 200.&nbsp;
They are surrounded by a dilapidated stone fence.&nbsp; Although an
Assam malee or gardener resides in them, they are kept in miserable
order: the soil seems good, the trees flourishing, mangoe, Diospyros,
Jubrung, oranges, citrons, pomegranates, are the principal trees.&nbsp;
The south side has a streamlet running along it outside the fence, for
the supply of water.&nbsp; This streamlet abounds with Acorus Calamus.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Our interview with the Deb took place.&nbsp;
We dismounted at the boards over the streamlets above mentioned, and
then proceeded over the wooden bridge across the Patcheen, which is
here a wide and deep stream: the bridge was partially lined with guards,
in different dresses, few in uniform; it was besides armed with shoulder
wall-pieces, capital things for demolishing friends.&nbsp; We then crossed
a sort of court-yard and then ascended a steep and extraordinarily bad
flight of steps to the door of the palace.&nbsp; Here we found the household
troops all dressed in scarlet with two door-keepers, one seated on either
side of the door: this led us into a quadrangle.&nbsp; The citadel being
in front, the side walls were rather low, although viewed externally
they appear of good height, but the ground of the interior is much raised.&nbsp;
We crossed this diagonally, passed into the opposite quadrangle on the
west side, and thence ascended into a gallery, hung with arms, and filled
with followers, from this we passed after a little delay into the Rajah&rsquo;s
room.</p>
<p>This was handsomely decorated with scarfs, the pillars were variously
ornamented.&nbsp; The Rajah was seated on an elevated place in the corner,
and appeared a good-looking well-bred man.&nbsp; He received the Governor
General&rsquo;s letter from P. with much respect, getting up from his
chair: the visit was a short one, and entirely of ceremony.&nbsp; The
presents were deposited on a raised bench in his front.&nbsp; Communications
were kept up by the Deewan and the Zimpay, formerly Joongar Zoompoor
or Governor.&nbsp; On retiring we were presented with fruits, oranges,
walnuts, horrid plantains, ghee, eggs and rice.</p>
<p>The whole business went off very well, no attempt at insolence.&nbsp;
The concourse of people was greater than I expected.&nbsp; Swarms of
Gylongs, the more curious of whom received whacks from leathern straps,
wielded by some magisterial brother.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday we saw the Dhurma, to whom
we had to ascend by several flight of steps, which are most break-neck
things, the steps overlapping in front, and being often lined with iron
on the part most subject to be worn.&nbsp; We found him in the south
room of the upper story of the citadel.&nbsp; We waived our right to
sitting in his presence as the question was put to us with respect and
delicacy.&nbsp; The Rajah is a good looking boy, of eight or ten years
old: he was seated in the centre, but in an obscure part of the room,
and was not surrounded by many immediate attendants.&nbsp; The balcony
was filled with scribes with handsome black, gilt, lettered books before
them.&nbsp; Two other scribes were likewise engaged on our right, noting
down what passed, but they seemed to be very bad writers.&nbsp; The
visit went off well.&nbsp; The room was tastily, but not so profusely
ornamented with scarfs as was the Deb&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>On returning we found the household guard drawn up in front to prevent
our passing out without paying a fee.&nbsp; This matter was soon settled
forcibly, and the durwan, or door-keeper, lost by his impudence the
present he would otherwise have had from P., besides being in a great
fright lest the affair should be reported to the Rajah.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>11th</i>.&mdash;The rains appear to have set in:
the sky is constantly overcast, and showers are by no means unfrequent.&nbsp;
One of our dawks arrived opened: this no doubt took place in the palace,
although the Deb strenuously denies it.&nbsp; Messengers are to be sent
to Tassgoung, where the accident is said to have happened.&nbsp; The
cause of its having been opened, is no doubt the report that there was
a letter in it from the old Deb.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;A violent squall unaccompanied by
rain, came on yesterday from the west: roofs were flying about in every
direction, and many accidents occurred from the falling of the stones
by which they were secured.&nbsp; Part of the palace was unroofed.&nbsp;
The storm has stopped all our amusements, particularly as the Gylongs
attribute it to our firing.&nbsp; The Kacharies, our servants, were
likewise requested not to play any more on the esplanade.&nbsp; This
is just as it has been in every other place in Bootan, nothing is said
against amusement until the presents have been received, and then we
are requested to do nothing, and the authorities become disobliging!</p>
<p>The potters fashion their earthenware entirely with their hands,
the upper half is finished on a flat board; the lower being added afterwards;
the finishing is done chiefly by a wet rag, the operator revolving around
the pot.&nbsp; The vessels chiefly used for carrying water are oval,
these are covered with black glaze.</p>
<p>Some Didymocarpi very fragrant, one near Chindupjee most grateful,
resembling quince and sandal wood; the odour is permanent, and appears
to reside in the young leaves before their expansion: Iris, Hypericum,
Viola, Ligust., Ranunculus, Verbasena, Gymnostomum, Serratula arenaria,
Veronica.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>
<p><i>Return</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Mission</i> <i>from</i> <i>Bootan</i>.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>9th</i>, <i>1838</i>.&mdash;We left Punukha at twelve,
having been delayed throughout the morning, on account of coolies.&nbsp;
We crossed the palace precints, and the two bridges unmolested.&nbsp;
Our road lay in the direction of our entering Punukha for some time,
but on the opposite bank of the river.&nbsp; We gradually descended
throughout this portion.&nbsp; Then at about eight miles turning round
a ridge, we followed a ravine to the west, some distance above its base,
gradually descending to the watercourse draining it.&nbsp; Thence we
ascended in a very circuitous route to Talagoung, the castle of which
is in a ruinous state: it is visible from the place whence one turns
to the westward.</p>
<p>Up to this point, which was certainly 1,200 feet above Punukha, no
change occurred in the vegetation.&nbsp; The country remained barren,
the ravines in favourable places being clothed with underwood, and as
we increased our elevation, with trees.&nbsp; Noticed a Bupleurum, Viburnum
sp., Ficus obliqua.</p>
<p>At 3,500 feet, Sambucus, Bupleurum sp., Potentilla as before, Gentiana
pinnata, Serissoides, Campanula.</p>
<p>At 3,800 to 4,000 feet, Pinus longifolia more common though still
a stunted tree; Emblica, P&aelig;deria cyaneum, Q. tomentosa, Primula
Stuartii, Parochetus, Pogonantherum, this is a most common grass about
here, it becomes more stunted as we proceed lower, and its extreme elevation
does not exceed 6,000 feet, Acorus very common, Adhatoda!</p>
<p>At 4,000 feet, Simool, Dipsacus as before, Aspidium, Macrodon, Rhododendron
minus re-appears.</p>
<p>On rounding the ridge, although we did not increase our elevation,
the country became more wooded.&nbsp; In some places Q. robur, Gordonia,
Pyrus were common, others and the greater portion were composed of Pinus
longifolia, Bucklandia re-appears at 4,500 feet, Azalea, Saccharum aristatum,
Hedera, Didymocarpus contortus, on rocks.</p>
<p>Towards the nullah we passed a village with some wheat and buckwheat
cultivation; Plantago, Ranunculus, Thymus, were interspersed.&nbsp;
Along the watercourse Symplocos styracifolius, which becomes a middling-sized
tree, was seen, and Stellaria cana, petalis albis profunda partitus,
as well as S. media.</p>
<p>Our section was as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m285.jpg">
<img alt="Section Page 285" src="images/m285.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>Telagoung</i> is a middling-sized, dilapidated castle, in which
it is settled the first blood is to be shed in the forthcoming contest,
it is occupied by the old Deb&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; Up to its walls, thickets
abound, and the fragrant rose was very conspicuous.</p>
<p>Its elevation is about 5,600 feet, yet a Ficus may be seen planted
by the side of Cupressus pendula, and Punica thrives.&nbsp; The change
in temperature was very great.&nbsp; Birds abounded throughout; a new
sombre-coloured dove was shot by P.: the most common birds were the
orange-billed shrike of towards Tumashoo.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>10th</i>.&mdash;We left Telagoung at 7 A.M. and descended
instantly to a small nullah, from which we re-ascended.&nbsp; The ascent
continued without intermission, occasionally gradually, but generally
rather steep for three or four hours.&nbsp; The descent occupied about
as long, and about three-fifths the distance, following nearly throughout
a small nullah.&nbsp; Woollakkoo, our halting place, is a good-sized
village, and fourteen and a half miles from Telagoung.</p>
<p>To the nullah I observed Stellaria cana, Berberis asiatica, which
has re-appeared, Erythrina, Rubus deltoid, which is very common all
over these parts and whose fruit is palatable, Uvularia, Swertia plantaginifolia,
C&aelig;salpinia, Mimulus, and Urtica foliis apice erosis.</p>
<p>The ascent commenced through woods of Q. robur, the shrubs consisting
of Gaultheria fragrans and arborea, a Myrsinea, Thibaudia serrata, whose
inferior limit is here, Rhododendron minus, but not very common.&nbsp;
A good deal of wheat cultivation and of better quality occurred at 6,500
feet, assuming Telagoung as 5,600 feet, Pteris aquilina common throughout
and up to 10,000 feet.</p>
<p>At 8,000 feet, Taxus re-appears, with Baptisia in flower, Thibaudia
orbicularis, Luzula of Chindupjee, Smilax gaultherifolia, Thibaudia
obovata, Fragaria vesca, which continues throughout, and has a range
of between 3 to 10,000 feet, Bambusa microphylla, and Acer sterculiacea
appear, woods of Q. ilecifolia, up to 7,200 feet, chiefly of Q. robur,
Gaultheri&aelig; two common ones, occur commonly.</p>
<p>At 8,500 feet, the woods composed chiefly of Q. castaneoides and
glaucum, Q. ilecifolia less common.&nbsp; No Q. robur, path-like glades
and rather open, Pythonium ecaudata, up to 9,000 feet, Primula pulcherrima
very common.</p>
<p>At 8,500 feet, Saxifraga of Khegumpa and of Chindupjee, Mitella,!

floribus rosaceis.</p>
<p>Smilacina, Ophiopogon, Urtica carnosa decumbens, Limonia laureola,
Pythonium ecaudatum.</p>
<p>At the same elevation and indeed below us, but on other ridges, cedars
were seen in abundance: Hydrangea and Hydrangeacea calyptrata, Epilobium
sp. withered.</p>
<p>At 7,800 feet, Aristolochia novum genus, Tritium glaucum, Thlaspi,
Arabis cordata, Loranthus, Symplocos sessiliflora.</p>
<p>At 7,900 feet, Lardizabalea.</p>
<p>At 8,000 feet, Hamiltonia?</p>
<p>At 9,000 feet, Crucifera floribus amplis albis, on mossy banks, with
Mitella, Spir&aelig;a densa.</p>
<p>Acer sterculiacea in forests, Cerasi sp. common.</p>
<p>Betula, Ribes, Arenaria, Lilium giganteum, Laurinea, Chimaphila,
Acer.</p>
<p>At 9,300 feet, Rhododendron hispida and rosaceum, Taxus, Pythonium
filiformia, Trillium album, Salvia of Royle, Rhododendron ferrugineo
and obovata, Smilacinia densiflora, Sarcococea, Daphne cannabinum, here
in flower, Anemone, Prunella, Hemiphragma, Cedar, but rare.</p>
<p>At 9,700 feet, Primula Stuartii in flower lower down, but here quite
past, Corydalis linetta, Viola, Juniperus, Viburnum floribus magnis
albis, Rhododendron deflexa, in flower.&nbsp; Acer: 1, vel. 2, Cerasi
sp. altera, Paris polyphylla, and from 7,000 feet, Iris foliis angustis,
Cerasus apetalus gathered below here a shrub, very common, Osmundia
alia, Berberis ilecifolia and integrifolia, Rosa microphylla, Spinis
latis, Baptisia, Corydalis altior floribus luteis, Aconiti sp., Papaveracea
succo aqueo, ferrugineo hispida, capsula siliquosa, 3-valvis, replis
totidem, stigmata radiata, 5-lobo.&nbsp; Prunella, Betula, Ranunculus
minimus, Carex, Mimulus! Sambucus of below, Salvia of Royle, Polytrichum
rubescens.</p>
<p>From the ridge the view to the south is pretty, the country undulated,
either naked and swardy, or clothed with firs.</p>
<p>Abies spinulosa commences: and is soon succeeded by Pinus pendula,
which, as we proceeded lower, soon became the chief tree; Rhododendron
obovata finely in flower, Lilium giganteum common.&nbsp; Trillium stratum,
Ribes lacineat.</p>
<p>Q. ilecifolia re-appears 500 or 600 feet below the ridge, Pinus spinulosa
common, with a Salix, grey pendulous lichens.</p>
<p>At 6,000 feet, P. pendula, Mespilus microphyllus, Larix, Rumex, which
has occurred throughout, Salvia alia viscosa foliis subhastatis trilobis,
Cycnia, Astragaloides! bracteis subvaginant magnis, Rosa latispina becomes
very common.</p>
<p>At 8,800 feet, Hedera, Hamiltonia re-appears, Galium sp., Juncus,
Oxlip, Clematis, Salix, very common.</p>
<p>At 8,500 feet, a village is seen to the right; Q. ilecifolia is the
chief tree, with P. pendula, Azalea, Baptisia, Pomacea of Rydang, Rhododendron
arbor. minus.&nbsp; Red-legged crow, pine chatterers.</p>
<p>At 8,000 feet, Baptisia continues; all alpine vegetation ceased;
Rhododendron minus continues, Q. ilecifolia, but no Corydalis, Anemone,
Iris, etc. although Oxlip does; Salix continues.</p>
<p>The descent to the halting place is marked by return to the old vegetation
indicated by re-appearance of El&aelig;agnus fragrans and Rosa tetrapetala,
Valeriana violifolia.</p>
<p>Baptisia rotundifolia and oblonga, this last a tree very common,
Pinus pendula chief tree, Pomacea celastufolia, El&aelig;agnus fragrans,
Rosa tetrapetala, very common along the nullah, Baptisia continues low
down, as Oxlip, Stauntonia alba, Viburnum, <i>Asteroides</i>, Jasminum
luteum, Tussilago, Spir&aelig;a bella, found about the level of this.</p>
<p>All the monocotyledons have a defined elevation; Smilacina cordifolia
is the lowest, except Uvularia, Lilacine&aelig; and Trillium, are the
highest, not being found much under 10,000 feet.&nbsp; There is an Osmundia
likewise on the ridge, the fronds below are not contracted, it is ferrugineo-tomentosa.&nbsp;
Hemiphragma has a wide range, between 6 and 10,000 feet: Salvia nubigena
of Royle, confined to 10,000 feet, Aconitum, Corydalis lutea, lenella
and c&aelig;rulea, Prunus penduliflora, Papaveracea, Juniperus, Rhododendron
obovata, Silacinea, Cerasus apetala, Ribes 2, are sure signs of elevation.</p>
<p>If the Mimulus be the same as that from Punukha, it has a very wide
range, as also Lilium giganteum, Pythonium filiformeis, limited, as
well as ecaudata, Crucifera, Anemone, Laurinea, Polytrichium, were all
definite.&nbsp; Mitella ranges between 9 and 9,500 feet, it is strange
that the chief variety in vegetation occurred on the Telagoung side,
on which springs are rare.&nbsp; No Thibaudias occurred on the other
side, Euphorbia was confined to the Woollakkoo side, as also Primula,
etc. etc.&nbsp; The chief cultivation about Woollakkoo is of wheat,
but from the mode of cultivation the plant is evidently adapted for
irrigation; rice is also cultivated.&nbsp; This is perhaps its maximum
height.&nbsp; The hills around are covered here and there with snow,
and must therefore be above 10,000 feet high.&nbsp; The highest were
to the north-west.</p>
<p>The river is of moderate size, fordable in most places, but still
well supplied with wooden bridges.&nbsp; Fish, in shoals too, were seen
here and there.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>11th</i>.&mdash;Our march continued down this river
throughout: we left its banks once or twice owing to ascending some
hundred feet above its bed, occasionally it spread out, but generally
was confined between the rocks.&nbsp; Its banks in some places were
planted with weeping willows.&nbsp; The vegetation throughout was much
the same.&nbsp; The most common plants were Rosa, this literally abounds,
Pinus pendula, Viburnum grandiflora, a Symphoria! Crat&aelig;gus 2 species,
Mespilus microphyllus, Lantonea, Jasminum luteum, Berberis asiatica
and obovata, Plectranthus canus, El&aelig;agnus fragrans, Stellaria
cana, Colquhounia, <i>Indigofera</i> sp. altera, Baptisia did not re-appear,
Euphorbia continues, as does the Celastrus noticed yesterday, which
commences at 8,500 feet.</p>
<p>Cycnia re-appears, it is in fruit, the cotyledons are not conduplicate.&nbsp;
In the fields Stachys, Potentilla (common), Brumus, Lamium of Khegumpa,
Cynoglossum, Thlaspi, Datura in waste places, Conaria, rare, Imperata!
Scabiosa of Bulphai.</p>
<p>A low shrub abounded on the road sides and walls, having all the
characters of Plumbago, a Lantonea likewise abounded, Fragaria, Swertia,
Taraxacum, Cardamina lilacina, Herminu sp., Marchantia, Astragalus,
Ranunculus; Carex, Potentilla supina, Potamogeton, Clematis grata, Poplars
were seen; of these, Taraxacum very common.&nbsp; Quercus robur re-appears
towards Lamnoo, as well as Juglans and Populus.</p>
<p>Weeping cypresses about villages, Hordeum hexastichum is commonly
cultivated, A. Buddl&aelig;a floribus lilacinis noticed yesterday was
found, its range is 8,500 to 7,500 feet, Zanthoxyla here.</p>
<p>A cuckoo was shot; this bird would seem to be as in Europe attended
by the Yunx, at least a cry very similar to that of that bird was heard.&nbsp;
Lysimachia of Punukha, Campanula re-appears.</p>
<p>The most common bird is Lanuis.&nbsp; The sombre-coloured dove too
is rather common.&nbsp; The wheat cultivated here is poor, a good deal
of the Bromus occurs with it.&nbsp; Astragalus is common on the borders
of the fields, and in some of them Ervum, Lamium and Vicia.</p>
<p>The whole upper surface of the column of Aristolochia of Telagoung,
is viscid and stigmatic, and likewise the margins of the depressions
in which the anthers are lodged, it is certainly akin to Rafflesiace&aelig;.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>12th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Chupcha, our march to,
and indeed beyond Panga, seven miles from Lamnoo, was through exactly
similar country.&nbsp; The hills naked or clothed with firs, the path
lay along the river Teemboo chiefly, but occasionally we met with one
or two stiff ascents.&nbsp; On reaching Panga it was determined to push
on to Chupcha, which was said to be but a short way off; we started,
and descended after some time to the river, above which Panga is elevated
about 1,000 feet.&nbsp; We continued along the river until we commenced
to ascend towards Chupcha, this ascent was very long and rather steep,
the road tolerably good.&nbsp; We found Chupcha to be ten miles from
Panga, and 8,000 feet high, the greatest height we crossed being 8,600
feet, and this day we were told, that all our climbings had ceased.&nbsp;
The road was generally bad, and well furnished with rocks: in one place
we passed from 100 yards along the perpendicular face of a cliff, the
Teemboo roaring underneath, the road was built up with slippery slabs
of stone.&nbsp; The country was generally very pretty, the scenery along
the river being very picturesque.&nbsp; We passed a waterfall of considerable
size, which is Turner&rsquo;s Minzapeeza.&nbsp; After leaving Panga
we came on an uninhabited country, nor did we see more than one village,
until we reached the ridge immediately above Chupcha, 1,000 feet above
this, there is a very large village inhabited by Gylongs, the bare summit
of the hill rising an equal height above it; snow visible to the south.&nbsp;
The greatest distance we descended was 6,500 feet, the greatest height
8,500 feet.&nbsp; The distance seventeen miles, the longest march we
have yet had.</p>
<p>The vegetation was nearly the same up to the time we turned off towards
Chupcha, it was characterized by a profusion of Rosa, among which the
Crat&aelig;ga, Symphorema, (which is less common than towards Woollakkoo,)
Rhamnus, Viburnum grandiflorum, Pinus pendula, Thymus, Cycnium.</p>
<p>In grassy banks of fields between Panga and Lamnoo, Astragalus, Ervum,
Vicia, Aster major, Rumex, Agrostia, in fields Hieraci&aelig; sp., Caricia
sp., Lactuca, Bromus.</p>
<p>Salix pendula about villages.&nbsp; After leaving Panga we came on
to a place called Minzapeeza, here Adiantum, Aspidium? Hamamelidea,
Cedrela? Rhus, Galium, Tussilago, Saxifraga ligularis, Valeriana violifolia,
Smilax flexuosa, Aruncus, Sarcococea, Azalea.</p>
<p>Rhododendron minus recommenced after leaving the river towards Panga,
a straggling cedar or two occurred, Populus rotundifol. very common,
Gaultheria arborea.</p>
<p>About Panga, Lithospermum, Oxalis corniculata, Umbellifera, from
the flowers of which <i>moud</i> is made, Rubus, Arabis, Taxacum, Dipsacus.</p>
<p>Beyond the waterfall the Quercus robur became common, forming beautiful
woods, it continued throughout until we re-descended to the river, range
7 to 7,500 feet.&nbsp; In these woods formed likewise by Pinus pendula,
Convallaria cirrhosa appeared, Rubia cordifolia, hispida, Paris polyphylla,
Aralia cissifolia, Mitella, Ribes! Spir&aelig;a, Asparagus, Epipactis,
Avularia, Houttuynia! Arum viviparum on rocks, Duchesmium, Populus oblonga
occurred also, Coriaria! Hedera common, Benthamia common.</p>
<p>On rocks along the river, Peperomia, 4-phylla, Populus oblonga, Acer
sterculiacea! Symphoria alia! Indigofera, Salix, Cedrela, Sassafras,
arbor facie, Gordonia, Vitis, Syringa, Serissa, Buddl&aelig;a, Sedum
on rocks, Eriophon ditto, Campanula cana, Pinus pendula, Rosa, Convallarium
cirrhosa, Polygonum robustum, foliis cordatis.</p>
<p>The ascent up to 7,500 feet, was marked by similar vegetation: up
to this point the prevailing shrubs gradually disappeared, they were
never so common as about Panga.&nbsp; Quercus robur having ceased, was
succeeded by Quercus ferruginea, which is much like Quercus ilecifolia,
and has very coriaceous leaves, this again at 7,500 feet, was succeeded
by Quercus ilecifolia, Dipsacus up to this, Pteris aquilina, Gaultheria
arborea.</p>
<p>At 7,600 feet, Rhododendron oblonga, a most beautiful species, Calyce
discoideo commenced, as also Rhodora deflexa and Rhodoracea ochrolenea,
which is, I think, that I before noticed as R. elliptica, foliis basi
cordatis subtus argenteis et punctatis, Euphorbia occurs also here,
as also the Rosa, Berberis asiatica.</p>
<p>At 8,000 feet, the trees were covered with grey lichens, and assumed
the usual highly picturesque appearance: noticed Primula Stuartii in
flower (Symphoria! ceased), Euphorbia, Gaultheria nummularifolia commences,
Artemisia major, Crat&aelig;gus odoratus continues, Saxifraga ligularis
common up to this, Ribes commences, Gaultheria of Bulphai, Galum, Hyperici
sp., Lilium giganteum, Clematis grata, Populus species, do not ascend
above this.</p>
<p>At 8,500 feet, Rhododendron minus, Rhododendron oblonga, ochroleucum,
Coccineum appears, Ribes, Smilax sanguinea, Gaultheria of Bulphai very
common, arborea stunted, Limonia major, Clematis grata! Rhododendron
hispida, Potentilla, Pteris aquilina, Berberis asiatica, Mespilus microphyllus,
Gnaphalium, Swertia, Viola, Patrinum! El&aelig;agnus fragrans! Thymus,
which ranges from 6 to 10,000 feet, Euphorbia, Pedicularis, Cycnii sp.,
Mimulus, Rhodora deflexa, Pinus pendula, Quercus ilecifolia, both stunted,
Pteris aquilina.</p>
<p>The descent to the village was about 500 feet, Arenarium on rocks,
Mimulus, Viola, Rumex, Juncus, Acorus veronica, Anagallis, Pythonium
of Blake, Euphorbia, Pedicularis, Carex, Mespilus microphyllus: pine
chatterers throughout, at least above 7,000 feet.</p>
<p>The summit, which was certainly 9,500 feet, was completely bare:
Pinus pendula ascends a long way.</p>
<p>Chupcha&mdash;Hordeum hexastichor in beautiful order, the chief cultivation.&nbsp;
Red-legged crow; larger dove.&nbsp; The form of the country traversed
is as follows:-</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m291.jpg">
<img alt="Teemboo to Chupcha" src="images/m291.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At Diglea we had an opportunity of seeing the mode of building in
this part of Bootan; the houses are made of mud, which is trampled and
beat down by men, who perform sundry strange evolutions while so employed;
the mud is beat down in a frame-work; it is from the different layers
formed that the lines seen outside finished houses result.&nbsp; The
mode is slow, but must give great firmness.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Ascended to the Gylong village, above
Chupcha, and then to the naked ridge.&nbsp; The village may be estimated
as being 8,700 or 8,800 feet above the sea, and that part of the ridge
to which I ascended as 9,800 or 10,000 feet.&nbsp; The ascent is uninterrupted
up to the village; it winds through a fine fir wood, after diverging
from the road to Panga, after that it is quite open, scarcely a shrub
being met with until the ridge is surmounted.&nbsp; On turning to its
northern face, woody vegetation becomes pretty abundant, and 500 feet
below, woods occur.&nbsp; This is contrary to what usually happens;
the south faces of mountains being supposed to be better wooded than
the others, but in Bootan the difference would seem to be due to the
piercing winds blowing from south, or up the ravine of the Teemboo.&nbsp;
The scenery was very pretty, both in the woods before reaching the village,
and from the ridge: vast quantities of snow visible to the north and
north-east.&nbsp; I ascended to within 1,000 feet of snow, and I think
that at this season, an elevation of 11,000 feet is required <i>in</i>
<i>open</i> <i>places</i> to secure the presence of snow: it is obvious
that local circumstances, such as shelter, etc. may cause it to descend
nearly to 9,000 feet, and it is as obvious that snow will descend lower
down a mountain of 15,000 feet high than one of 12,000; the difference
in the beds of snow causing a greater reduction of temperature in the
one than in the other.&nbsp; In an isolated mountain, an elevation of
11,000 feet will be required for the presence of snow in May.</p>
<p>At 8,000 feet, Baptisia, Viburnum canum, Umbellifera toxicaria, Colquhounia,
Deutzia, the Symphoria of Teemboo.</p>
<p>At 8,200 feet, Salix, Abies spinulosa straggling, Rhododendron microphylla
commences, the bruised has a terebenthaceous odour, Ilex, Gaultheria
flexuosa, Parus major: variegated shortwing, Papilio machaonires.</p>
<p>At 8,300 feet, Saxifraga ligularis.</p>
<p>At 8,400 to 8,500 feet, Limonia, Viburnum grandiflorum or canum,

in the middle of the day.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>15th</i>.&mdash;Left Chupcha for Chuka, distant seventeen
miles.&nbsp; Our march commenced by a very steep and indeed almost precipitous
descent to the nullah, at the foot of Chupcha, of 1,800 feet.&nbsp;
Thence we ascended gradually until we reached a temple visible from
Chupcha, at which place we returned to the course along the Teemboo.&nbsp;
The remainder of the road undulating, varying in level from 6,000 to
6,500 feet, until we commenced the descent to Chuka, which was long
and tedious: we reached this at 5&frac12; P.M.&nbsp; The road latterly
was very bad, we passed Punukha, a small village, about 300 feet below
our path.&nbsp; The mountains closing in the Teemboo continue lofty,
at least 9,000 feet.&nbsp; Iris, cedars, and Abies densa, were common
on the loftier parts.</p>
<p>We passed some beautiful places, indeed the march throughout was
pretty.&nbsp; The vegetation was beautiful, owing to the quantity of
water on the road, a stream occupying each hollow, round many of which
we wound.&nbsp; Glades and pieces of green sward were not uncommon.</p>
<p>The Lamium of Bulphai is found about Chupcha.&nbsp; On the descent
to the nullah the following plants were found.</p>
<p>At 7,000 feet, Iris commences, with a species of Lychnis, ground
bare and rocky, Umbellifera cana, Umb., from which <i>moud</i> is prepared,

than the first crossed.&nbsp; Alnus became common soon, the pines disappeared,
Osmundia common, Primula rotundifolia, Paris polyphylla, Bletia as of

<p><i>May</i> <i>16th</i>.&mdash;The fort of Chuka not being whitewashed,
is not conspicuous: its situation is strong, and against Bhooteas would
be impregnable.&nbsp; It occupies a low hill arising from the centre
of the valley, one side of which is washed by the Teemboo or Tchien-chiw.&nbsp;
The room we were lodged in was a good one.&nbsp; The village is a mean
one, and consisting of three or four houses.</p>
<p>We crossed the river by a suspension bridge much inferior to that
of Benka, and then rose gradually and inconsiderably, following the
Teemboo.&nbsp; To this we subsequently descended by a most precipitous
road built for the most part on the face of a huge cliff: we reached
the Teemboo at its junction with a small torrent; the tongue of land
here was strewn with huge rocks, and bore evidences of the power of
the torrents, for it evidently had been once a hill, such as that we
had just descended.&nbsp; Thence we continued ascending, following the
river, from which however we soon diverged to our right, but not far.&nbsp;
The road was rugged beyond description.&nbsp; As we approached Murichom,
it improved somewhat, but was still very bad.&nbsp; We reached this
place which is visible for some distance at 5 P.M.; the march being
one of eighteen miles.&nbsp; No villages occurred en route.&nbsp; The
hills were densely wooded to the summits and much lowered in height
than those to which we had been accustomed.&nbsp; Passed two waterfalls,
one less high, but more voluminous than the other, is the Minzapeeza
of Turner; both these occurred on the left bank of the river.&nbsp;
Minzapeeza, is a fall of great height, but the body of water is small.</p>
<p>The vegetation to-day partook much of the subtropical character,
almost all boreal plants being left behind.&nbsp; We ascended and descended
between 3,000 to 4,500 feet near Chuka, Parkioides, Mimosa arborea!
and M. frutex.&nbsp; Magnolia! Rubia munjista, Impatiens! Cucurbitacea!</p>
<p>Oxyspora latifolia! Rosa fragrans, Incerta ribesioides, Piper! Urtica
heterophylla! Wendlandia! Phytolacea, Daphne nutans, Rottleria! Curculigo
orchediflora, Acer, Eurya pubescens, Rhus, Alnus! Adamia, Gordonia!
Q. robur reappears at a lower elevation than before seen: Dipterocarpioides
arbor vasta trunco ramoso! Smilax auriculata! Pothos pinnatifid! Briedlia
oblonga! Corydalis, Dipsacus, Acanthace&aelig; common, Rubiace&aelig;
of a tropical character, such as Ophiorhiz&aelig;; Celastrus! Pythonium
majus, Tetranthera macrophylla! Quercus coriacea! Gaultheria arborea
scarce, Deutzia on the descent to the Teemboo, Macrocapnos, Sterculia
platanifolia, Melica latifolia! Arundo! Achyranthes densa! Labiata spinosa
of Khegumpa or Phlomis, Labiata, Quercoides.&nbsp; The rocks on the
river side are covered with Epiphytical Orchide&aelig;; Saurauja sterculifolia,
Pythonium pallidum, El&aelig;agnus fragrans.</p>
<p>Along the banks of the Teemboo, Pandanus! Rhododendron azaleoides,
R. pulchrum, Lyellia, Begonia picta, Composita arborea! Ficus! on ascent
above its banks, Dioscorea! El&aelig;ocarpus! Acrosticum atratum! Convallarium
oppositifolia, Thibaudia loranthiflora! Pogostemon of Dgin! Leea!&nbsp;
The only northern plant a species of Viola; Otochilus linearis! Entada!
Kydia! Muss&aelig;nda! Macrocapnos altera of Yen, Callicarpa arborea!
Panax aculeato palmiformis supra decomposit&aelig; of Dgin! Solanum
farinacium! Urena lobata! Marlea, Panicum plicatum!&nbsp; Before ascending
to Murichom we made two descents to two streams, crossed by common wooden
bridges: that nearer Murichom being the largest; elevation at 2,500
feet.&nbsp; Here tree-fern; Pythonium majus, Duchesnia, Lysimacha, Begonia
of Punukha! Caryophyllea scandens, Urtica gigas! Modeceoides exembryonata!
Commelina! Combretum sp.! B&aelig;hmeri&aelig;! Piper spica caudata
pendula and another species!! Euphorbia! Galina of Panga, Croton malvifolius!
Bambusa major! Bauhinia! Engeldhaardtii!</p>
<p>Although we subsequently ascended 1500 feet, very little change occurred:
no re-appearance of tropical forms, Sterculiacea novum of Moosmai, Adamia,
Volkameria! serrata, Triumfetta mollis! Briedlia ovalis of Chilleeri!
Gortnera! Corydalis! Hydrangeac&aelig;! Melastoma malabathrica!</p>
<p>The march was very tiresome, some of the ranges passed were high
and well clothed with firs.&nbsp; Those marked thus* are subtropical
or tropical, and one glance will show their predominance: only Corydalis
straggles down.&nbsp; The woods were in many places damp, in others
dry: it was obvious that less rain had fallen between Chupcha and Chuka,
than in other situations: a large proportion of Laurine&aelig; and Acanthace&aelig;
appeared in the woods, with Gordonia: the oaks and chesnuts when they
did present themselves bore a tropical form, pointed out by their coriaceous
undivided or merely serrated leaves.&nbsp; I certainly never saw such
a predominance of tropical forms, at such an elevation as 3,500 or 4,000
feet.</p>
<p>For Lyellia I had been hunting for three years, but never thought
of looking for it at low elevations; as it was I believe given out to
be a native of high places.&nbsp; Of birds, Bucco, Picus intermedius,
green pigeon, azure shrikelet, occurred.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Murichom is a small village of eight
or nine thatched houses, it is well and prettily situated: about it
maize and wheat are in cultivation, Ficus, Hoya, Dendrobium, Croton
malv&aelig;folius, Meliacea, Cedrela Toona, orange, Verbesina, Datura,
Artemisia major, Echites, in fact it would be difficult to point out
an elevational plant.&nbsp; The same remark applies to the march to
Gygoogoo, distant twelve miles, and situated 500 feet below the road,
but still it is about the same level as Murichom.&nbsp; The march commenced
with a steep descent, followed by a steeper ascent, then winding along,
in and out, at an average elevation of 5,000 feet.&nbsp; The road was
very bad, rocky and rugged as usual, P. and B. passed the village, and
pushed on to Buxa, a distance of twenty miles, which place they reached
at 7 P.M.&nbsp; At Murichom, Ficus cordata, fructibus pyriformibus,
Clerodendron infortunata, Adamia, Spilanthes, Melastoma malabathrica,
Bignonia, Pentaptera.&nbsp; The Oollook or Simia Hylobates, of Upper
Assam.</p>
<p>Scarcely any thing worth noticing occurred; the vegetation being
precisely the same.&nbsp; No oaks or chesnuts, at least comparatively
few: El&aelig;ocarpus, Rhus, Gordonia are the most common trees; Pythonium
common, Hoya rotundifolia.&nbsp; Gygoogoo, a small village of two or
three houses, was passed.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>18th</i>.&mdash;Marched to Buxa, ascending from Gygoogoo
over a wretched rocky road, winding in and out.&nbsp; No water was to
be had until we reached a ridge from which to Buxa is one continued
descent.&nbsp; This ridge is between 5 and 6,000 feet, and yet there
is scarcely a change in the vegetation.&nbsp; Pythonium abounded, especially
P. majus, which literally occurred in profusion.&nbsp; The trees towards
the top of the ridge were covered with moss, but all appeared subtropical;
a few chesnuts, E. spinosissima occurred, Bambusa nodosis, verticillatis,
and spinosis.</p>
<p>En route thither, Pholidota imbricata, Thib. loranthiflora, Aralia
terebinthacea, Rottleria foliis peltatis, Ranunculus of Taseeling, Meniscum
majus, Byttneria ferox, Caladium foliis medio discoloratis s&aelig;pius
atratis, Gnetum, Ixora, Choulmoogra, Phlogacanthi sp., Corisanthes of
Sudya, Acer platanifolia, Croton foliis oblongis irregularis dentato-lobatis
occurred before, between 2,500 to 3,500 feet, Calamus, wild plantains
as before, Gordonia, Rhus, Mimosa, Rottleria, Wallichia, Sida cuneata,
Tradescantia cordata, &AElig;schynanthus fulgens, et altera, Tupistra,
Lobelia baccifera, Costus, tree-fern, as high as 5,000 feet, Bambusa
fasciculata; of birds, the large Bucco.</p>
<p>At 5,000 feet, Thibaudia serrata, and on this side, as low as 2,500
feet, myrtifolia, Gordonia, Pythonium majus and medium, cinnamon, Piper,
Acer platanifolia, Mucuna, Angiopteris, Saurauja ferruginea.</p>
<p>At 5,300 feet, Polygonia pinnatifolia, Hookeria macrophylla, Aralia
scandens, etc. as before.</p>
<p>On descent nothing remarkable, except steepness: same vegetation.&nbsp;
Pythonium majus not below 3,000 feet, Guttifer&aelig; at 3,000 feet,
Acanthace&aelig;, Carduaceus 2,800 feet.</p>
<p>At 2,500 feet, Buchanania undulata, Hyalostemma undulatum, Roydsia.</p>
<p>What can be the cause of this tropical elevation at such altitudes?&nbsp;
Buxa is hot enough for any tropical plants, as jacks, mangoes, Cactus,
etc. are found in fine order.&nbsp; It is not attributable to a gradual
rise, as the ascent from this to 5,500 feet, is excessively steep.&nbsp;
It must be owing to local causes modifying the climate: at 5,000 feet
on the Dgin route, there are many elevational plants, indeed more than
of subtropical.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that no Pinus longifolia exists on this
route after leaving Telagoung.</p>
<p>Buxa is a rather pretty place, but as usual poor: the Doompa&rsquo;s
house is the only decent one in the place, the others, amounting to
eight or ten, are common huts.&nbsp; The big house occupies an elevation
in the centre of the pass, being cut off from the neighbouring hill
on either side by a ravine, one of which is now quite dry, the other
affords a scanty supply of water.&nbsp; The hills are covered with jungle,
the only clearing being about Buxa, and this, except the flat summit
of the hill, is overrun with bushes, Capparis modecea, Croton malv&aelig;folia,
Menisperma trop&aelig;olifolia.&nbsp; Berger&aelig; 2 species, Ixora,
Brucea same as of the plains, Atriplex, Tournefortia of plains, M&aelig;sa
macrophylla, Mimosa scandens, Ficus elastica in good order, jacks, mangoes,
oranges, plantains, Tabernamontana, Calamus, Cedrela Toona, are found.</p>
<p>Black pheasants, Bulbuls, Drongoles, Oorooa, Bucco, green pigeons.&nbsp;
Long-tailed blue-crested shrike, etc. are found here.&nbsp; The Doompa,
or Chong Soobah, is a man of no rank, and the place itself is of no
importance, except as the pass or entrance between the mountains of
Bootan and the plains of Bengal.</p>
<p>The descent from Buxa is gradual at first and not unpicturesque:
after passing a small chokey about half a mile from Buxa, sandstone
of a coarse nature commences.&nbsp; The descent is very steep, and continues
so until within a short distance of a place called Minagoung, at which
the bullocks are unladen at least of heavy baggage.&nbsp; The remaining
descent is very gradual, and continues so for several miles.&nbsp; The
march throughout and until the level of the plains is reached, was through
tree jungle.&nbsp; The underwood being either scanty or consisting of
grass.</p>
<p>On reaching the plains, the usual Assamese features presented themselves,
viz. vast expanses of grass, intersected here and there with strips
of jungle.&nbsp; Reached Chichacootta about 3 P.M.: distance eighteen
miles, of which about fifteen were over either level or very gradually
sloping ground.&nbsp; No villages occurred, and only one path struck
off from the Buxa one.&nbsp; We passed two or three halting places.</p>
<p>The vegetation throughout was subtropical.&nbsp; At the same elevation
as Buxa, noticed Cassia lanceolata, Torenia the common Leucas, Bheir,
Solanum quercifolia, Banyan, Alstonia, Styrax, Caryota, Elephantopus,
Osbeckia linearis, Herminioides, Wedelia scandens.</p>
<p>At 1,500 feet, Celastrus guttiferoid, Malvacea digyna, of which I
found flowers on the path, K&oelig;mpfera terminal, Antidesma, Anthericum,
Echites arborea, Careya, Mimosa scandens, Pavetta, Rubiacea alia, Lepidostachys,
Lagerstr&oelig;mia grandiflora, Leea crispa, Costus, Thunbergia grandiflora,
Gordonia, Commelina, Phyllanthus, Briedlia, Dioscorea, Cassia fistula.</p>
<p>As we approached a lower level, the same plants continued: a Dillenia
very common, Urena lobata, Hedera terebenthacea: the root is in some
cases like figs, Spathodea, Nauclea, Sterculia carnosa, foliis palmatis,
Dalbergia, Panax, Semecarpus, Rhaphis trivialis, Cymbid. alvifolium,
Sarcanthus guttatus common, Apocynea fauce, 10-glandulata, Ixora, etc.</p>
<p>Saul was not common, nor did I see one tree of any size; it commenced
about the margin of the Toorai.</p>
<p>Among the grasses forming the underwood of the Toorai and the grassy
masses clothing the plains, Sacchara were the most common and the most
conspicuous: next to these a species of Rottboellia.&nbsp; Sciurus Bengmoria
occurred, Hemarthria, Greweia edulis, Leea crispa, Crinum in the Toorai,
Viburnum of Sudya, Millingtonia pinnata, Volkameria serrata, Labiata
Sudyensis, Muss&aelig;nda erecta, humilis, Cinchona, Premna herbacea,
Ph&oelig;nix pumila.</p>
<p>Arrived at Chichacootta, a small village, situated in an open grassy
plain, miserably stockaded; and lodged in a good well elevated house.&nbsp;
The following day started and reached Cooch Behar territory, after crossing
a considerable but fordable stream.&nbsp; The contrast between the desolate
territories of Bootan, and the sheet of cultivation presented by Cooch
Behar was striking.</p>
<p>The same contrast continued until we reached the Company&rsquo;s
territories, and its less cultivated portions along the bed of the Brahmapootra.&nbsp;
The only plant worth notice on the route, was a species of Swertia;
the vegetation being almost precisely the same as in Upper Assam.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>
<p><i>Journey</i> <i>with</i> <i>the</i> <i>Army</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i>
<i>Indus</i>.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <i>Loodianah</i> <i>to</i> <i>Candahar</i>
<i>through</i> <i>the</i> <i>Bolan</i> <i>Pass</i>.</p>
<p>I reached Loodianah on the 10th December 1838, after a d&acirc;wk
journey of fourteen and a half days.&nbsp; After passing the Rajemahal
Hills, the country presents an uniform aspect, but becoming more sandy
as one proceeds to the northward.&nbsp; The hills alluded to, form a
low range, the only one of any height being that called Pursunath.&nbsp;
They are well wooded, the under-vegetation being grassy.&nbsp; Undulating
ground bare of trees, but provided with shrubs, is passed before coming
on the wooded tracts, the vegetation of these present much similarity
with that of even 31&deg; N.&nbsp; The <i>Dhak</i>, Pommereulla, Zizzyphus,
occurring.&nbsp; The <i>Mahooa</i> occurs in abundance on the hills,
but does not reach much beyond Cawnpore.&nbsp; The country from the
hills upwards, is almost entirely cultivated; very few trees occurring,
and those that do, are almost entirely mango.&nbsp; The Borassus does
not extend in abundance much beyond Benares, but the <i>Khujoor</i>
is found everywhere in sandy soil.</p>
<p>Loodianah is situated about five miles south of the Sutledge, in
the midst of a sandy country, very bare of trees.&nbsp; The fort and
Capt. Wade&rsquo;s house are situated on a rising ground, at the base
of which runs a nullah, a tributary of the Sutledge.&nbsp; There is
much cultivation about the place, chiefly of grain, barley and wheat,
bajerow, cotton, the latter bad, but there is much land uncultivated.&nbsp;
The surface is often flat and somewhat broken; in such places there
is much of a low prickly <i>Bheir</i>, much used for making fences.&nbsp;
This and <i>Dhak</i> jungle, which occurs in strips, form two marked
features, the <i>Dhak</i> occurs in patches.&nbsp; The grasses, which
occasionally form patches, are Andropogoneous; Anathericum, Pommereulla,
and Eleusine occur.</p>
<p>Sugar-cane occurs; it is cultivated in thick masses, it is poor,
and always fenced with the <i>Bheir</i>.</p>
<p>The most common trees are the mango, Parkinsonia, <i>Babool</i>,
Acacia altera babooloides, a Leguminous Mimosoid tree, Tamarisk, a middling
sized tree and very pretty, Ficus.</p>
<p>The hedges about the cantonments, etc. are formed by prickly pear;
much Ricinus occurs in waste places, and it appears to me to be different
from that to the south.</p>
<p>The most varied vegetation occurs along the nullah, but consists
entirely of aquatic or sub-aquatic plants; among these the most common
are two or three Scirpi, particularly a large rush-like one, a large
Sparganium, a very narrow leaved Typha, Hydrocharis! a pointed leaved
Villarsia, Potomogetons three or four, one only natant; Chara, Naias,
Ceratophyllum, Ulva, Valisneria, Marsilea, Herpestes, Jussieua repens,
Fumaria common in fields.</p>
<p>The town is a large bustling place: the houses low and regular, and
of a somewhat picturesque style, built of brick, the streets are wide
and regular, having been laid out by our officers.&nbsp; There is a
good deal of trade, and the place is filled with Cashmereans, who may
be seen working their peculiar shawls, and producing very beautiful
dyes.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>22nd</i> <i>and</i> <i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Violent
south-east winds during the day; abating at night.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;Arrived at Hurreekee, having halted
on the previous day at Mokhoo, a small village, with the usual style
of mud fort.&nbsp; The marches were as follows: from Loodianah to Ghosepoora
is eight miles; to Boondree, eight miles; Tiraia, ten miles; to Durrumkote,
ten miles; to Futtygurh, ten miles; to Hurreekee, ten miles.&nbsp; Thus
Hurreekee is at least eighteen miles from Durrumkote, although we had
been told it was only five.&nbsp; The country near Loodianah, and, perhaps
as far as Durrumkote, is occasionally very sandy, but beyond that it
is easily traversed by hackeries.&nbsp; Being much less cultivated and
overrun with grasses, among which Andropogons are the most numerous
and conspicuous, these grasses are either coarse and stout or wiry and
fine, should afford excellent cover for game, which however, does not
seem to be very abundant.&nbsp; Very few trees are visible in any direction,
and although neither very much cultivation nor many villages are visible,
it would appear from charts that the country is very populous.&nbsp;
The most interesting plant was a species of Fagonia.</p>
<p>Durrumkote is the largest of the villages we passed, and has a respectable
looking mud and brick fort.&nbsp; Inside the village is filthy; the
houses wretchedly small, and the streets very narrow.&nbsp; It is much
the same sort of village as other Seikh ones.&nbsp; In the bazars cocoanuts
were noticed.&nbsp; All the Seikhs eat opium, and very often in a particular
way by infusing the poppy-heads, from which the seeds have been extracted
by a hole in the side; great numbers of these are found in the bazars.</p>
<p>Hurreekee is on Runjeet&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; I crossed the Sutledge,
which is between 400 to 500 yards broad with a sufficiently rapid stream,
by a bridge of boats built by the Seikhs, under the superintendence
of Mr. Roobalee.&nbsp; It contained 65 boats, placed alternately up
and down the river; the boats were moored to posts: over them were placed,
both lengthwise and across, timbers, then grass, then soil; many elephants
passed over, until it gave in, but was quickly repaired, and since many
more hundreds of camels, horses, and thousands of people have passed.&nbsp;
The right bank is thirty feet high, the left low and sandy.&nbsp; The
country where uncultivated, is clothed with grasses, and the only trees
visible are perhaps the Pipul; the <i>Jhow</i> occurs but not the Parhass;
a few Bukeens are visible, Ricinus, Salvadora, which is occasionally
a climber, especially at Tiraia.&nbsp; The river rose suddenly on the
night of the 6th and carried away the bridge.&nbsp; The Himalayas had
been seen very distinctly throughout the day, so that the rain must
have been local: the height of the rise was three feet.</p>
<p>We left Hurreekee on the 8th at 10 A.M., the river up to this time
(9th) presents the same monotonous appearance&mdash;sandy banks clothed
with grasses, intermixed with <i>Jhow</i> here and there, and occasionally
&AElig;schynomene, and Typha.&nbsp; Very few villages have been passed,
nor does the rare occurrence of topes indicate that there are many near
it.&nbsp; The channel has been throughout much subdivided, and flats
are of frequent occurrence.&nbsp; Yesterday we passed two busy ferries,
at which two or three boats were unceasingly employed, and there was
an obvious demand for more.&nbsp; Black partridges were heard frequently,
black-bellied tern, herons, cormorants, etc.&nbsp; The stream averages
three miles an hour.&nbsp; Parkinsonia was seen near Hurreekee.&nbsp;
Reached Ferozepore at 12&frac12; on the 9th; it is a very busy ghat,
more so than that of Hurreekee: two large godowns were passed on the
Company&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; The river is wider by 100 yards than at
Hurreekee.</p>
<p><i>10th</i>.&mdash;Reached Mamdot at 9&frac12; A.M.&nbsp; The fort
appears of good size, with high walls: it is about half a mile from
the river.&nbsp; The country continues the same.&nbsp; Some wheat cultivation,
in which Fumaria, Anagallis, Medicago are abundant; Calotropis Hamiltonii
common; some grapes; <i>doob</i> grass wherever there is or has been
cultivation.&nbsp; The only trees I see are Babooloid, but not the true
<i>Babool</i>, which has very odorous flowers, and is always an arbuscula,
a shrubby <i>Bheir</i>, spina una erecta, altera recurvo also occurs;
among the fields, Lathyrus, Aphaca, and a Composit&aelig; which has
the leaves of a thistle, are common.</p>
<p>Halted at Buggeekee, which is, I imagine, the Pajarkee of Tassin&rsquo;s
Map.</p>
<p><i>11th</i>.&mdash;Continued passing down, breakfasting at Attaree:
few signs of villages, but a good deal of cultivation.&nbsp; Persian
wheels not unfrequently employed in raising water from the river: a
short channel having first been cut in the bank, and the banks, when
loose, propped up.&nbsp; Wheat, radishes, etc.&nbsp; Grasses appear
to be much less common, while the <i>Jhow</i> is increasing much.&nbsp;
The river is much subdivided, and the actual banks are scarcely discernible
owing to the want of trees.&nbsp; The soil and current remain the same:
no impediments have been met with by our boats, nor have I yet observed
any to tracking, the grass jungle being easily overcome, and very unlike
that of the Brahmapootra, and the <i>Jhow</i> not reaching that height
necessary to make it troublesome.&nbsp; The Nawab of Mamdot visited
the Envoy today, accompanied by a small party of horsemen.&nbsp; Only
two alligators have been seen thus far: no game even to be heard, and
but few living creatures visible.</p>
<p><i>12th</i>.&mdash;The river becomes even less interesting than before;
the channel is occasionally much narrowed by sands, over one of which
we found yesterday evening some difficulty in passing; it is much more
spread out and subdivided, and from this circumstance, will occasion
difficulty in tracking up.&nbsp; The banks are low and generally within
reach of inundation: scarcely a village is to be seen; and <i>Jhow</i>
is the most uniform feature.&nbsp; Yesterday evening saltpetre was visible
in abundance on some of the higher banks, and on these <i>Phulahi</i>,
<i>Jhow</i>, a Composita, and Salsola? or Chenopodium were observed.&nbsp;
Since the 10th, the few boats seen are of different structure from those
to which we had been accustomed; they are flat, less wide, and much
better fastened together, elevated at both ends; they are propelled
as well as guided by the rudder, which is curved, so as to bring it
within reach of the helmsman, who is on a level with the bottom of the
boat.&nbsp; Very little cultivation: Tassin&rsquo;s Map of but little
use, as few of the names are recognised by the boatmen or villagers.</p>
<p>Paukputtea was passed to-day; it is the shrine of a <i>fakeer</i>,
and one in great repute, as passing through a particular gate is supposed
to authorize one to claim admittance into Paradise.&nbsp; The Moulavee
consequently has proceeded there in full faith and extravagant joy:
with natives of the east such absurdities are to the full as much believed
by the educated as by the uneducated; indeed the former are much the
more bigoted of the two.&nbsp; The <i>fakeer</i> alluded to, not only
lived for years on a block of wood carved into the likeness of a loaf,
but subsequently suspended himself for several years in a well, without
even the wooden loaf.&nbsp; He is then said to have disappeared, and
is no doubt now enjoying all the pleasures of a Mohammedan paradise.&nbsp;
We were detained by strong winds at a small village opposite Paukputtea,
which is situated on rather high ground, as far as could be judged from
the distance.</p>
<p><i>13th</i>.&mdash;The cultivation round this village consists of
wheat, radishes, a sort of mustard cultivated for its oily seeds, and
the Mehta of Hindoostan.&nbsp; Among the fields I picked up a Melilotus,
a Melilotoid, and a genuine Medicago, which is also found at Loodianah,
both these last are wild, and their occurrence is as curious as it is
interesting; the latter being a decidedly boreal form.&nbsp; In connection
with these annuals I have to observe, that most flower about January
or February, at which time the mornings and nights are the coldest:
also observed Lathyrus cultivated, a Chenopodium was also found, Calotropis,
a large Saccharoid, Amaranthace&aelig;, were the most common plants,
Gnaphalium, Lippia; <i>Purwas</i>, occurs scantily.</p>
<p><i>14th</i>.&mdash;Detained till 12 P.M. by bad weather.&nbsp; Sissoo
not uncommon but small, <i>Babool</i>, the true sweet scented sort.&nbsp;
The Colocynth seen in fruit much like an apple, not ribbed; it has the
usual structure of the order, viz. 3-carpellary with revolute placent&aelig;,
so much so, that they are placed near the circumference; seeds very
numerous, surrounded with pulp, not arillate: no separation taking place;
oval, brown, smooth.&nbsp; In fields here, a wild strong smelling Umbellifera
occurs, called <i>Dhunnea</i>, used as a potherb, and esteemed very
fragrant by the natives.&nbsp; Besides the absence of an arillus, there
is another anomaly about the above Colycynth, which is, that between
each placenta a broad partition projects from the wall of the fruit,
usually provided with 3-septa, so as to be divided into two chambers,
these contain seeds, the funiculi passing completely through them; seeds
are also contained between the outermost septa and the placent&aelig;
themselves.</p>
<p>Passed two or three villages.&nbsp; The Persian wheels continue in
vogue; their site is always on a sufficiently high and tenacious bank.&nbsp;
I observed some wells, communicating with the river by an archway in
the bank.&nbsp; Most of the cattle are blinded by the conical blinkers
or hoods over the eyes.</p>
<p><i>15th</i>.&mdash;Halted at a village partly washed away, surrounded
by a good deal of wheat and radish cultivation.&nbsp; The mango tree
and Moringa also occur here with the larger <i>Babool</i>, which invariably
has long white thorns.&nbsp; The small Sissoo still occurs.&nbsp; Snake
bird seen, black crowned tern.</p>
<p>The river remains most uninteresting; the banks are low and covered
chiefly with <i>Jhow</i>.&nbsp; In many places recent shells are very
abundant, but do not appear to be composed of more than three species.&nbsp;
Reseda, Oligandra in fields.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;No change in the country.&nbsp; Heavy fog yesterday
morning; to-day strongish north-east winds.&nbsp; Grass and <i>Jhow</i>
about equal.</p>
<p><i>17th</i>.&mdash;Cloudy, drizzling, raw weather; river more sluggish;
more villages and more cultivation: Phascum, and Gymnostomum common
on tenacious sand banks.</p>
<p><i>18th</i>.&mdash;Weather unsettled; windy and rainy.&nbsp; <i>Jhow</i>
and grass jungle continue, Tamarisk, <i>Furas</i> fine specimens, Fumaria
continues in fields, Capparis aphylla, which has something of a Cactoid
habit, and whose branches abound with stomata, Reseda.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;Weather finer but still cloudy, north-east wind
still prevalent, and impeding our progress in some of the reaches very
much.&nbsp; Salvadora, Capparis aphylla, <i>Phulahi</i>, <i>Bheir</i>,
large <i>Babool</i>, <i>Furas</i>, Ranunculus sceleratus: <i>Jhow</i>
and grass jungle are the prevailing features.&nbsp; Current much the
same, only occasionally sluggish.&nbsp; Pelicans, black-headed adjutants,
(Ardea capita,) wild geese, ducks very numerous in the jheels formed
by alteration in the course of the river; the country is more cultivated,
but as dreary looking as imaginable.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;nix becoming more
frequent and finer, P. acaulis? likewise occurs occasionally, rather
young <i>Khujoors</i>.&nbsp; We passed Khyrpore about 3 P.M., it seems
a straggling place, stretching along the bank of the Sutledge; there
are a great many <i>Khujoor</i> trees about it, and indeed about all
the villages near it.&nbsp; A little below this large tract, the banks
were covered with a thick <i>Sofaida</i> shrubby jungle, which looked
at a distance like dwarf Sissoo.&nbsp; The country is much improved,
and there is a great deal of cultivation, especially on the left bank.</p>
<p><i>20th</i>.&mdash;Continued&mdash;the river is very winding, and
its banks present the same features: the immediate ones being covered
with short <i>Jhow</i> or grass, or both intermixed, the extreme ones
well wooded, and well peopled.&nbsp; <i>Khujoor</i> very common.&nbsp;
Yesterday near Khanpore, caught a glimpse of the descent, and to-day
again the ground appears uneven, and almost entirely barren.&nbsp; It
must be within a mile of the Sutledge.&nbsp; The left bank continues
well cultivated.&nbsp; In some of the fields I noticed Medicago vera,
Anagallis, Fumaria, Chenopodium cnicoideus, Prenanthoid, the <i>Furas</i>,
larger <i>Babool</i>, and Calotropis Hamiltonii continue.&nbsp; Radishes
very common, as also <i>Teera</i> <i>Meera</i>.</p>
<p><i>21st</i>.&mdash;Halted about 8 coss from Bahawulpore.&nbsp; The
Khan&rsquo;s son, a boy of 8 years, came to see Mr. Macnaghten, and
saluted him with &ldquo;good night,&rdquo; he was attended by about
twelve indifferent pony <i>suwars</i>, or horsemen.&nbsp; The river
is very tortuous, both banks a good deal cultivated; there appear to
be a good many canals, which have high banks owing to the excavated
soil being piled up: they are 8 or 10 feet deep, and about 20 feet wide,
at this season they are nearly dry, becoming filled during the rains.&nbsp;
The same plants continue&mdash;<i>Furas</i>, <i>Jhow</i>, Chenopodia
2, Reseda, Linaria, Malva, Boraginea, Lactucoidea.&nbsp; The wheat throughout
these countries is sown broadcast.&nbsp; Irrigation is effected by means
of small ditches, and squares formed in the fields&mdash;each partition
being banked in, so as to prevent communication; when one is filled,
the water is allowed to pass off into its neighbour, and so on.&nbsp;
Irrigation is entirely effected by Persian wheels; the cattle are hoodwinked
in order to keep them quiet: besides from not seeing, they are led to
imagine that the driver is always at his post, which is immediately
behind the oxen and on the curved flat timber which puts the whole apparatus
in motion.&nbsp; Saw a man cross the river by means of a <i>mushuk</i>
or inflated skin.&nbsp; The very common bushy plant with thorns and
ligulate leaves which commences to appear about Hazaribagh and continues
in abundance throughout the sandy north-west, is, judging from its fruit,
which is a moniliform legume&mdash;a Papilionacea; the fruit are borne
by the short spine-terminated branches: the stalk of the pod is surrounded
for the most part by a cupuliform membranous calyx.&nbsp; I have only
seen however withered specimens.&nbsp; Reached Bahawul ghat at 1 P.M.&nbsp;
The Khan visited Mr. Macnaghten in the afternoon, his visit was preceded
by one from his Hindoo minister, and another man, Imaam Shah, who is
a very fat ruffianly-looking fellow.&nbsp; The Khan was attended by
numerous <i>suwarries</i>; he is a portly looking, middle-aged man.</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;We returned the visit to-day, the Khan having
provided us with one horse and two bullock <i>rhuts</i>: we traversed
the sandy bank of the river for about a mile before we reached the town,
the suburbs of which are extensive, but very straggling, and thinly
peopled.&nbsp; The inner town seemed to be of some extent, the streets
narrow, the houses very poor, and almost entirely of mud; there were
a number of shops, and the streets were lined with men and a few old
women.&nbsp; There is very little distinction in appearance between
the Khan&rsquo;s residence and any other portion of the town, and I
did not see a defence of any kind.&nbsp; The Khan received us on some
irregular terraces; near his house, the street leading to the private
entrance was lined with his troops, as well as that leading to the terrace,
and this was surrounded with his adherents, variously and well-dressed.&nbsp;
The troops, for such appeared, were decent, and those forming one side
were dressed in white, in imitation of our Sepoys, and the other side
were in red and blue, <i>more</i> <i>proprio</i> I imagine: they were
armed with muskets; the red ones for the most part having muskets of
native workmanship.&nbsp; A royal salute was fired when the meeting
took place, which was on the terrace, and as we proceeded up the street,
a band made a rude and noisy attempt at &lsquo;God save the King.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Having had a private consultation, Mr. Macnaghten withdrew with similar
honours, presenting arms, etc.&nbsp; The presents were a handsome native
rifle, with a flint lock, and the fabrics of the city, some of which
called Kharse, were very creditable.</p>
<p>There are a good many trees about the place, indeed these form the
chief mark when seen from the ghat: the principal are mangoes, <i>Khujoors</i>,
Moringas, oranges.&nbsp; The natives are rather a fine race, but dirty:
some of the women wore the <i>Patani</i> veils, or hoods, with network
over the eyes.</p>
<p>Continued down the river; though much delayed by strong south-east
winds.&nbsp; The vegetation, etc. continue the same, Potentilla sp.
in flower, Phascum very common.</p>
<p><i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Nothing new has occurred: the current is stronger
than above Bahawulpore: the channel continues very winding, and sandbanks
very frequent.&nbsp; <i>Furas</i>, Salvadora, <i>Phulahi</i> very common.&nbsp;
The boats accidentally separated, and we went without dinner in consequence:
came into the Pungnud.&nbsp; The mouths of the Chenab seem to be two,
both apparently of no great size, yet the Pungnud is a noble river,
and although much subdivided by sand banks, is a striking stream, the
waters are very muddy, and when agitated by a strong wind become almost
reddish.&nbsp; The jungle continues much the same: the Sissoid jungle
again occurred to-day, the natives call it <i>Sofaida</i>; it has a
very curious habit, and is gemmiferous, the gemm&aelig; abounding in
gum.&nbsp; Quail, black-grey partridge, hares, continue; a goat-sucker
(Caprimulgus,) was seen.</p>
<p><i>24th</i>.&mdash;The boats joined early this morning: we were delayed
the whole day by strong north-east winds; the whole country was obscured
by the dust.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;The wind abated towards evening, and occurred
again in gusts during the night.&nbsp; This morning we came in sight
of the southerly portion of the Soliman range, by which name however,
these mountains do not appear to be known hereabouts; their distance
must be forty miles at least, yet they appear to be of considerable
height: the range runs north and south nearly.&nbsp; Wheat is here sown
in rows.&nbsp; <i>Khujoor</i>, large <i>Babool</i>, Fagonia, continue,
<i>Jhow</i> very common.&nbsp; Towards evening we came to a subdivision
of the stream following the smaller one in which the current was very
strong; in some places, apparently six knots an hour.&nbsp; We came
to for the evening at a village on the limits of the Bahawul territory.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;We came on the Indus early in the morning and
stopped opposite Mittunkote until 2 P.M., awaiting the arrival of Mr.
Mackeson.&nbsp; The mouths of the Attock river are scarcely more striking
than those of the Chenab; neither is the combined river immediately
opposite Mittunkote of any great size: certainly the stream we followed
was not more than 800 or 900 yards wide, the extreme banks are at a
considerable distance; and half a mile below Mittunkote the surface
of the water must be one and a half to two miles in breadth; the river
is much subdivided by banks, and shallows are frequent, yet some of
the reaches are of great extent.</p>
<p>The banks are low and rather bluff, the vegetation continues the
same, but <i>Jhow</i> is far the most common plant.&nbsp; <i>Bheir</i>,
<i>Babool</i>, and the <i>Seerkee</i> Saccharum continue; the cultivation
is the same; Calotropis Hamiltonii.&nbsp; Mittunkote appears, from a
distance of two coss, a place of some size, with a somewhat conspicuous
dome.&nbsp; Immediately behind it are the Soliman Hills, of no great
altitude; and, except at the bases, which are covered with black patches
of forest, they appear uniformly brown, otherwise there is nothing to
vary the monotony of the scene, scarcely any trees being visible.&nbsp;
On stopping for breakfast, a general scene of embracing among the dhandies
or boatmen and their friends occurred; women were also embraced in the
usual way, but with apparently less tenderness or warmth than the men.&nbsp;
The boats tracking up, have masts, but the goon or rope is seized with
both hands, a plan far less advantageous than that adopted on the Ganges
and Bramahpootra, where the principal tracking is exercised by a bamboo
placed over the shoulder, farthest from the goon.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;No change worth noticing.&nbsp; The current continues
rapid.&nbsp; The hills visible, running parallel to the river, and ending
very gradually.&nbsp; Typha is very common, and in some places Arundo.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;We remain in sight of, and generally continuing
in the same direction as the hills, which run out very gradually indeed.&nbsp;
Scarcely a tree is to be seen, and very few villages.&nbsp; The country
continues to have some vegetation.&nbsp; The <i>Sofaida</i> is now found
in flower, it is the <i>Ban</i> of the natives of these parts; the former
name indicates in Persian, a tree, said to be wild Poplar, with which
this has an obvious affinity.&nbsp; Saccharum <i>Seerkee</i> very common,
growing in tufts and covering extensive tracts.&nbsp; Scarcely any cultivation
is to be seen along the river, and altogether a very small proportion
is rendered available.&nbsp; River very much subdivided: towards evening
the sky is obscured to leeward by the smoke arising from burning jungle.&nbsp;
Waterfowl are very common along the Indus; especially wild geese, which
frequent open streams, whereas ducks, etc. haunt places which only communicate
with the main streams during floods: myriads of <i>Bogulas</i>, (the
general name for herons,) were seen yesterday in a compact body.&nbsp;
The Soliman mountains are by no means rugged, and this only in one or
two places, where they become peaked.&nbsp; In Mr. Elphinstone&rsquo;s
account of a Journey to Cabul, the limestone said to be found in the
desert contains shells; it would be most interesting to compare this
with the limestone of Churra more especially.&nbsp; Mr. E. also mentions
a wild rue as forming part of the very scanty vegetation of the desert;
the chief plants being <i>Kureel</i>, which is a Capparis; Phoke ----
and <i>Bheir</i>.&nbsp; Mr. E. also says that the material of which
the tope of Manikyalah is built, resembles petrified vegetable matter,
an observation to be kept in view.&nbsp; The mottled kingfisher occurs
throughout, but is commoner in southern latitudes of India.</p>
<p>Alligators abounded to-day, and it was curious to see them basking
in the sun with flocks of herons so close, that at a little distance
they appeared to be perching on the backs of the alligators, or rather
crocodiles.&nbsp; Again saw a man swim the Indus by means of a <i>mushuk</i>
or inflated skin: he swam very rapidly, and with great ease; half his
body nearly being out of the water; he reclined on the skin and kept
the aperture by which it is inflated in his mouth, carrying his clothes
on his head.&nbsp; Passed Chuck about 4&frac12; P.M.&nbsp; The country
appears populous hereabouts.</p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;We have seen a good many boats today employed
in carrying grain to the camp; the smaller ones are not unlike Bengal
boats, having a high stern; all on the Indus however have square bows
and flat bottoms.</p>
<p>The <i>Jhow</i> has increased in size in some places as has <i>Sofaida</i>,
which is occasionally a moderate tree, and it is now more advanced in
flowering: the temperature having visibly increased.&nbsp; The river
puts on the same features and is much subdivided; the channels by which
we have come, are not above 400 to 500 yards in breadth, yet there is
often seen to be a waste of low sand banks stretching to a great extent,
and the extreme banks are very remote, so as generally not to be visible.</p>
<p><i>31st</i>.&mdash;Arrived at Uzeeypore about 9 A.M.&nbsp; Here we
found horses and camels for our conveyance to Shikarpore.&nbsp; Uzeeypore
appears to be a well frequented passage of the river, although we did
not see any ferry boats.&nbsp; Bukkur is visible from it, apparently
occupying a hill almost to the extreme right of a low range running
south-west; it is seven or eight coss distant.&nbsp; We left for Shikarpore
about 2&frac12; P.M. and reached about 7 P.M.: the distance is said
to be twenty-four miles; the road is generally very sandy, although
the sand is not very deep; the substratum being solid.&nbsp; We passed
some cultivation and a few villages, at one of which (Khye) there is
a neat sort of fortification; here we changed horses.&nbsp; The jungle
throughout consisted of Furas, Tamarisk, Salvadora, <i>Phulahi</i> parva,
the prickly Leguminosa, with the habit of Fagonia, Calotropis Hamiltonii,
Saccharum.</p>
<p>Shikarpore is not visible until one reaches the clearing around the
town; in the twilight it appears to be a very large place.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;We do not proceed to Larkhanu,
as daily news from Hyderabad is expected.&nbsp; I see nothing likely
to interest me about this place; there is absolutely not a flower to
be got any where.&nbsp; The jungles consist of <i>Jhow</i>, small <i>Furas</i>,
<i>Rairoo</i>, a small arbusculoid Mimosa, <i>Kureel</i>, and Ukko,
Calotropis Hamiltonii; <i>Bheirs</i> shrubby; one of the most abundant
plants is the <i>Joussa</i> or prickly Leguminosa, with the habit of
Fagonia; some of the saline loving Composit&aelig;, No. 51, frutex 2-3
pedalis, foliis carnosis lanceolato-spathulatis, sessilibus.&nbsp; Corymbis
et Cymi axillaribus et terminalibus pauci capitat.&nbsp; Floscules inconspicuis,
also occurs.&nbsp; Near the Shah&rsquo;s tents there is a grove of <i>Phulahi</i>,
all more or less demolished, and a good many <i>Khujoors</i>.&nbsp;
Hares and grey partridges appear common.&nbsp; The changes of temperature
are very great; in the mornings and evenings it is cold; in the afternoon
the thermometer reaches as high as 82&deg;.</p>
<p><i>9th</i>.&mdash;Shikarpore is getting hotter every day: thermometer
ranges from 40&deg; to 85&deg;.</p>
<p><i>15th</i>.&mdash;The heat continued to increase until the 12th;
the range of thermometer being from 50&deg; to 95&deg;; the evenings
gradually became hotter, and the night although cool, had the peculiar
thrilling coolness of tropical nights.</p>
<p>On the 12th, the barometer commenced falling, and has since continued
to do so.&nbsp; The visible signs of rain have been confined to cloudy
mornings; the fall of the mercury is perhaps connected with the occasional
strong northerly winds, which at times, as last night, blow nearly half
gales.&nbsp; The range of thermometer is now from 55&deg; to 85&deg;.&nbsp;
The change was sudden on the 9th or 10th; the nights were cold, thermometer
at 5 A.M. 34&deg; 36'; and the days were only moderately warm.&nbsp;
The weather now is pleasant.&nbsp; Shikarpore is disagreeable <i>inter</i>
<i>alia</i> from its dust, every thing becoming covered with it.</p>
<p>The suburbs of the city are well wooded, and all such portions are
well provided with gardens.&nbsp; The <i>Khujoor</i> is the most common
tree, the Moringa, mango, <i>Jamun</i>, <i>Bheir</i>, <i>Neem</i>, Cassia
fistula, Sissoo, <i>Peepul</i>, <i>Furas</i>, <i>Phulahi</i>, another
Mimosa and Agati, occur; oranges in gardens, and a Pomaceous tree from
Cashmere, which appears to thrive very well.&nbsp; The cultivation consists
chiefly of wheat, <i>Mahta</i>, mustard, radishes, <i>Soonf</i>, coriander,
beet, <i>Bagree</i>.</p>
<p>In these fields Phascum, Plantago, Ispaghula, Singee, Chenopodiace&aelig;
1-2, Salsola lanata, and B&oelig;hmeria, may be found; Composita salinaria,
stocks and wall-flowers in the gardens.</p>
<p>The vegetation elsewhere is very scanty; consisting of <i>Jhow</i>,
<i>Bheir</i>, <i>Furas</i>, <i>Ukko</i>, <i>Joussa</i>, Andropogon <i>Seerkee</i>,
<i>Rairoo</i>, <i>Kureel</i>, a low bush called ----, and a Lycium?
B&oelig;hmeria albida.</p>
<p>The town is miserably defended: the streets are very irregular and
very narrow: the houses all of mud, of the usual Scindian form, and
completely irregular.&nbsp; The bazaars or arcades, are mere ordinary
streets, covered in with timbers, over which tattered mats are placed:
in these are situated the Hindoo shops, and in some places darkness
is completely visible.&nbsp; These Hindoos have a peculiar elongated
Jewish aspect, and are reported to be very wealthy.&nbsp; Grain and
cloth are the principal articles in which they deal, and they say the
streets are covered in order that the purchaser may buy with his eyes
half shut.&nbsp; The city is a large rambling place, and each house
deposits its own filth before it.&nbsp; The inhabitants, especially
the Hindoo portion, have a peculiar complexion, and by no means a healthy
one.&nbsp; No one seems to have deserted the town on account of our
approach, neither has fear hitherto prevented them from bringing their
merchandise into camp.</p>
<p>The weather has continued cool: yesterday we had a good deal of rain;
to-day it is very cloudy.&nbsp; The range of the thermometers from 46&deg;
and 48&deg; to 82&deg; outside.</p>
<p>Artificers are not uncommon, as carpenters and blacksmiths, but their
tools are miserable: and there is no such thing as a large saw to be
seen.&nbsp; Wages are high, and from the slowness with which they work,
it is ruinous to employ them.</p>
<p>Left Shikarpore on the 21st and marched to Jargon, 13&frac12; miles,
one of the usual fortified villages of <i>kucha</i> or unburnt brick.&nbsp;
Houses surrounded also with <i>Jhow</i> fences.&nbsp; The jungle and
country precisely the same as that round Shikarpore, road at first bad,
but subsequently good enough: water is to be had very good: at no great
depth.</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;To Janidaira, 11&frac12; miles: road excellent
throughout.&nbsp; Country less covered with jungle: features mostly
the same: a curious looking plant occurred plentifully, but to a limited
extent near Jargon and subsequently, as the country became more sandy,
we had abundance of Salicornia, of which camels are excessively fond,
otherwise <i>Jhow</i>, <i>Furas</i>, very common, <i>Rairoo</i>, <i>Kureel</i>,
<i>Ukko</i> throughout; near Jargon, Elrua very common, Chenopodium
cymbifolium throughout.</p>
<p>The soil at first is very fine, finely pulverized, brownish as we
proceeded onwards, becoming more and more sandy.&nbsp; Hills of some
height, apparently very distant, are seen ahead due north, and to the
west.&nbsp; We passed one village to the left, two canals of small size,
and some <i>Bagree</i> cultivation.&nbsp; A small ridge with a hillock
occurred after passing the village, otherwise all was flat.&nbsp; And
about this the jungle was thin, entirely of patches <i>Kureel</i>, <i>Rairoo</i>,
and <i>Furas</i>, Peepul.</p>
<p>We had a violent north wind yesterday evening with some rain.</p>
<p><i>23rd</i>.&mdash;To Rogan, distance 11 to 12 miles: country generally
flat, presenting here and there sandy undulations, generally bare of
vegetation.&nbsp; Salvadora, <i>Jhow</i>, <i>Furas</i>, <i>Kureel</i>,
<i>Rairoo</i>, continue; <i>Furas</i> and <i>Rairoo</i> most common;
a new Chenopodium and a Salsola, or a plant of the same genus as that
met with yesterday, swarming in some places, both species were common
in some parts, in others one of the two only occurred.&nbsp; Road generally
excellent, level and unbroken.&nbsp; Two small ghurrees or forts occurred,
with a large patch of cotton, and still larger of <i>Bagree</i>: a small
Sedoid-looking plant with yellow flowers, and one or two other (to me)
novelties occurred: Heliotropium, Fagonia, <i>Joussa</i>, <i>Bheir</i>.&nbsp;
In those parts in which loose sand had become accumulated, it not only
formed banks, but every bush was submerged in it.&nbsp; The fresh sand
must be derived from decomposition of the hard level plain by the action
of the air: yet there should be a regular gradation in size of the waves;
those nearest the windward side of the desert ought to be the smallest.&nbsp;
Rock pigeon of Loodianah seen.</p>
<p>There are two ghurrees or forts at the halting place, both small;
the water is tolerable.&nbsp; The chief trees are Salvadora and <i>Rairoo</i>.</p>
<p><i>24th</i> <i>and</i> <i>25th</i>.&mdash;Left in the evening and
marched all night through the desert, which commences within two miles
of Rogan, and towards which place vegetation gradually becomes more
scarce until it disappears entirely.&nbsp; This sandy waste is upwards
of twenty miles in extent: in the direction we traversed it, NW. or
NNW., it is almost totally deprived of vegetation; one or two plants,
such as Salsoloid, being alone observable near its borders.&nbsp; The
surface is generally quite flat, in some places cut up by beds of small
streams: the surface is firm, and bears marks of inundation: tracks
of camels, etc. being indented.&nbsp; We reached Bushore at 5&frac12;
A.M.; the camels performed twenty-six miles in ten hours.&nbsp; We halted
for four hours in the centre of the desert and tried to sleep but the
cold was too great, striking up as it were from the ground.&nbsp; The
camels marched through without halting, and we suffered only one loss
amongst them next day.&nbsp; The occurrence of this peculiar desert
is unaccountable, especially its almost absolute privation of vegetation;
for many other places, equally dry, have their peculiar plants, such
as Salsola, Chenopodium, <i>Furas</i>, <i>Rairo</i>, <i>Ukkoo</i>, <i>Kureel</i>.</p>
<p><i>25th</i>.&mdash;Bushore is a miserable place, consisting of the
usual mud houses and defences: the adjacent nullah does not invite attention;
it is however the only seat of wells, which, as in all this country
since leaving Rogan, are of small diameter, from thirty to forty feet
deep, and contain very little water, which also is rather brackish and
well impregnated with sand.&nbsp; The surrounding country is so barren
that it may be called a desert, while the desert itself may be called
the desert of deserts.&nbsp; I should mention that this ceases first
to the west, in which direction shrubs encroach on it.&nbsp; <i>Phulahi</i>,
Evolvulus acanthoides, Tribulus, <i>Kureel</i>, etc. are found about
Bushore, but the prevailing plant is Chenopodium cymbifolium.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;Leaving Bushore, we proceeded to Joke, which we
reached late, it being nineteen miles: we lost the road however, which
is in a direct line only sixteen miles.&nbsp; We soon came on a nullah,
or canal, which we followed to Meerpore, a rather large double village,
with a nice grove of <i>Furas</i>, situated on the dry river Naree,
which is as contemptible in size as deficient in water, this is only
procurable by digging wells of thirty feet deep, and even then in small
quantity.&nbsp; Before reaching it, we passed several villages, mostly
deserted and ruined.</p>
<p>The country is frightfully bare of wood; the chief plant is Chenopodium
cymbifolium, and along the canal lemon grass, <i>Kureel</i>, <i>Rairoo</i>,
<i>Joussa</i>, <i>Ukko</i>, <i>Bheir</i>, etc.; near Meerpore a Centaurea,
and Evolvulus acanthaceus.&nbsp; But along the nullah some wood may
be found, stunted though it be, it is chiefly <i>Rairoo</i>.&nbsp; We
left Meerpore and proceeded about one and a half mile from Joke, following
the nullah until we came on a canal in which, from a bund having been
thrown across, there was a puddle or two of water.&nbsp; Here we halted.&nbsp;
Much remains of cultivation is presented about this, chiefly <i>Bagree</i>,
which is perennial.&nbsp; Durand tells me that the sprouts of the second
year are poisonous to cattle, i.e. horses; but this report may have
been given out purposely by the natives.&nbsp; Along the river, <i>Jhow</i>
and <i>Furas</i> occur, in the naked plains, Chenopodium cymbifolium,
<i>Rairoo</i>, and a few <i>Kureel</i>, but they are so naked as to
afford little fodder for the camels: there is a little cultivation of
mustard, and <i>Taira</i> <i>meera</i>.&nbsp; The hills are about twenty
miles off, and appear about 4,000 feet high, they are precipitous, but
the outline is not rugged: they appear perfectly barren.&nbsp; Those
to the north which run nearly east and west are more distant.&nbsp;
No new birds were seen; rock pigeons occur.&nbsp; The soil would be
rich if water were abundant: in the <i>Bagree</i> fields it is of a
cloddy kind.</p>
<p>Reseda, Euphorbia, Salsola lanata, Chenopodium cymbifolium, Evolvulus,
Panicum, and Andropogon occur here.&nbsp; <i>Jowaree</i> sells at twelve
seers a rupee, and <i>Khurbee</i> is very dear.&nbsp; A large plain
occurs here covered with Gramen Panicum, which is in tufts, and has
the appearance of being cultivated.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;Halted at our camp near Joke.&nbsp; The Naree
runs one and a half mile to the westward: its bed is fifty yards wide
and about ten feet deep; the banks are well clothed with <i>Furas</i>.&nbsp;
There is a good deal of <i>Bagree</i> cultivation.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;To <i>Oostadkote</i>, nine and a half miles.&nbsp;
The road is not a made one for the latter one-third.&nbsp; Crossed the
Naree about two miles from our encampment: the country appeared the
same.&nbsp; On arriving near our halting place, green wheat fields,
intermixed with much fresh Chenopodium, Gramen Panicum, Reseda were
most abundant, Chloroideum, Sinapis, Raphanus cultivated with <i>Taira</i>
<i>meera</i>, two Cruciferous plants common, Salsola lanata also occurs.&nbsp;
Water abundant in a channel of fifteen yards wide and three feet deep,
clear and tasteless.&nbsp; <i>Furas</i> the most common shrub.&nbsp;
No grass occurs but the remains of Panicum.&nbsp; Wheat is here sown
in drills, in some places the crop is promising.&nbsp; The country is
evidently occasionally overflowed, witness the indurated surface and
the fissures, which away from the road, renders it bad for camels, being
full of holes.</p>
<p>There are several villages visible round our camp, all of the usual
miserable description, and there is a good deal of <i>Bagree</i> cultivation.&nbsp;
The water does not extend more than a mile; it is eight feet deep, and
about twenty yards wide towards the head, where the bund is thrown across.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;To Bagh nine and a half miles.&nbsp;
The country is quite similar: the chief plants continue to be Chenopodium
cymbifolium, <i>Kureel</i>, a <i>Rairoo</i>, <i>Ukko</i>, <i>Joussa</i>,
and Salsola robusta, but occur in no great plenty, they and all the
face of the country exhibit marks of inundation.&nbsp; Bagh is visible
a long way off from its being ornamented with a gamboge, or ochre-wash,
otherwise its aspect is poor and muddy.&nbsp; We came on the Naree about
three miles from the town, and as it has been bunded, it is full of
clearish blue water, to a good depth.&nbsp; We encamped about one and
a half mile on the south side of the town.&nbsp; About the head of the
bund there is a good deal of wheat cultivation, and some mustard.&nbsp;
In these <i>khets</i> Reseda is very abundant, Heliotrope is also common;
I picked up a Matthiola and a Pommereulla.&nbsp; The banks of the Naree
are clothed with small <i>Furas</i>, which in these parts are always
encrusted with saline matter, or, as it would seem, pure salt.&nbsp;
Rock pigeons both sorts, Loodianah rats, etc.</p>
<p>Bagh is celebrated for gunpowder; it is a largish, straggling, but
poor place, though thickly tenanted.&nbsp; Its latitude is 29&deg; 1'
20&quot;, and is placed thirty miles too far south in Tassin&rsquo;s
last map.&nbsp; Sugar-candy from Bussorah and cloth, are the principal
articles sold.</p>
<p><i>4th</i>.&mdash;Marched sixteen miles to Mysoor: direction at first
NNW. and latterly west, close to the Brahorck hills.&nbsp; Water is
plentiful in bunds and river, but the country is very very bare, Salicornia
robusta uncommon, Plantago canescens, Poa, Cynodon, <i>Ukko</i> is very
common, otherwise <i>Kureel</i> is the predominant plant.&nbsp; A good
deal of wheat cultivation, every thing depends on water: the wheat along
watercourses is luxuriant, but where water is less plentiful, stunted:
soil the same, a tenacious sandy clay when wet: fields very free from
weeds.&nbsp; Reseda very common, but very small, Heliotropium ditto,
Crucifera hispida ditto.&nbsp; Green wheat a maund for a rupee.&nbsp;
The road or rather country, is intersected here and there by ravines.</p>
<p><i>5th</i>.&mdash;Halted.&nbsp; The nearest range of hills are six
miles off, they have a very peculiar irregular brown appearance.&nbsp;
The higher ones also have a similar appearance; these appear quite precipitous,
and have in some parts a curious crenated outline.&nbsp; The chief vegetation
about this place is <i>Kureel</i>, especially along the river and towards
the bund, which last is well filled with water.&nbsp; <i>Kureel</i>,
<i>Furas</i>, <i>Ukko</i>, very common, Cynodon, Prenanthoid, Poa minima,
<i>Joussa</i>, Fagonia, Saccharum, Nerioid.&nbsp; In the water Scirpus,
Cyperaceus, Char&aelig; two species, Potomogeton two species, Valisnaria,
Typha.&nbsp; On banks, Plantago cana, a curious <i>Sileneacea</i>, a
splendid Orobanche, and a Brassicacea.</p>
<p>The birds continue the same: there is abundance of Fulica, swarms
of waterfowl, herons, plovers, etc.; starlings re-appear.</p>
<p>Some wheat fields well irrigated; most luxuriant <i>Khujoors</i>,
radishes.</p>
<p><i>6th</i>.&mdash;Marched to Nowshera, sixteen miles: five first
miles across a plain scantily furnished with <i>Kureel</i>.&nbsp; Sturt
tells me the country looks quite a desert to the eastward from one of
the hills.&nbsp; Thence we came on the hills, through which and the
dividing valleys we proceeded for two miles, thence emerging into a
narrow valley in which Nowshera is situated, drained by the river of
Mysoor, which is an insignificant running stream.</p>
<p>The hills are very curious, totally bare of vegetation, not more
than two or three stunted Chenopodium cymbifolium being seen on or about
them.&nbsp; They do not exceed 300 feet in height; their composition
is various; they are much worn by rain, and the outline although generally
sharp, is often rounded.&nbsp; They present great variety, but chiefly
are of a soft clayish looking substance, distinctly enough stratified,
the uppermost strata being indurated and often quite smooth, and of
a sub-ochreous appearance.&nbsp; The outer ridges on each side of the
range slope gradually outwards, and the surface in these slopes is smooth.&nbsp;
Inside, or towards the inner part of the range, they are generally precipitous,
but beyond the uppermost strata, the exposed face is not indurated,
hence this can scarcely arise from exposure to the weather.&nbsp; In
these places they look much like sandstone, the fragments at the base
of the cliffs are clayey, mixed with brown angular masses, occasionally
shingle, and indeed, a low ridge near the north side of the range is
chiefly of shingle.&nbsp; The direction is NNE., the angle of inclination
of the slopes say 30&deg;.&nbsp; The hills are highest towards the centre,
and here some of the strata are curved.</p>
<p>The plain between this and the main range is much broken by ravines
caused by rain; it is thinly covered with <i>Kureel</i>, Salsola robusta,
Chenopodium, etc.&nbsp; The vegetation along the river is the same as
at Mysoor.&nbsp; Durand finds nummulites, but thinks them brought down
by the river.&nbsp; The strata or rather debris of slips often intersected
by nearly erect projecting lines of a fibrous dyke.&nbsp; There is some
wheat cultivation in the fields, a new Plantago, a Ruta, Silenacea,
a curious Composita, two Boragine&aelig;, Phalaris, Phleum, Avena, two
or three Crucifera, Trigonella, and Melilotus are to be found.&nbsp;
The vegetation elsewhere is much the same, <i>Rairoo</i>, <i>Kureel</i>,
<i>Ukko</i>, Chenopodium, Lycium albidum re-occurs.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Dadur, a distance of seven and a half
miles, nearly north.&nbsp; The country is a good deal cut up by water:
within two and a half miles of Dadur we crossed the Naree, a running
stream, with small boulders, and high clayey banks.&nbsp; The country
improves towards Dadur, topes becoming more frequent.&nbsp; Salsola
lanata abundant: a good deal of cultivation occurs along the river.</p>
<p><i>10th</i>.&mdash;Dadur is a good sized, and more orderly looking
place than Bagh, and is ornamented with well wooded gardens, among which
the <i>Khujoor</i> holds a conspicuous place.&nbsp; An elegant and large
<i>Bheir</i> and a Mimosa, are two other trees of the place; it is situated
on the left bank of the Bolan river.&nbsp; The bed of this river until
the Levee bund was cut, had been dry, but there is now plenty of water
in it.&nbsp; It is in some places much choked by bulrushes, etc., it
is eighty yards broad, and is shingly.&nbsp; Dadur stands nearly on
the end of a good sized plain, surrounded on all sides by hills, of
which those traversed to Nowshera, run NNE. and are lowest.&nbsp; The
main range is four or five miles off.&nbsp; The greater part of this
plain is uncultivated and covered with <i>Rairoo</i>, <i>Kureel</i>,
<i>Joussa</i>, Sal. lanata, and Chenopodium; but along the sides of
the river, as well as near that crossed en route to this place from
Nowshera, there is a highly luxuriant cultivation of wheat, bearded
and beardless, and barley.&nbsp; In some places near the town, are rich
gardens of <i>sonff</i>, coriander, <i>Mola</i>, cress, onions, carrots,
beet, among which a few poppies and Cannabis occur.&nbsp; These, as
well as the fields, are protected with loose <i>Bheir</i> fences.&nbsp;
There are a few small villages around, all of the same kucha or temporary
construction, together with some remains of cotton, which in these parts
is perennial.</p>
<p>There are no wild trees to be found, excepting perhaps an elegant
species of willow.&nbsp; The vegetation of the fields is highly interesting,
consisting of many European forms, similar to those at Nowshera&mdash;Avena,
Phleum, Polygonium, Zanthoxyloid, Erodium! Anagallis in abundance, Plantago,
<i>Pecagee</i>, Cynodon two species, Andropogon, Melilotus, Medicago,
Boraginea, Malva, Tetragonolotus, Astragaloides, Sperguloides, Crucifer&aelig;.</p>
<p>In the bed of the river Nerium, P&aelig;derioides, Crotalaria, etc.
of which the former is common every where: Fagonia, Viola found in the
bed of the river crossed en route hither, a very curious plant.&nbsp;
Antirrhenoid was brought from the hills by Capt. Sanders, singular in
the inequality of the calyx and the great development of the posticous
sepal.</p>
<p>Altogether this spot is curious in regard to vegetation, for the
mean annual temperature must be high, and the winter temperature by
no means low enough to account for the appearance presented.</p>
<p>The only novel birds are a jackdaw, with the voice and manners of
the red-billed Himalayan species, and which I have only seen at a distance,
and a different sort of Pterocles.</p>
<p><i>11th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Drubbee, eight miles from Dadur,
and about three within the range of hills, the plain towards which is
rather elevated, and generally covered with boulders and shingle.&nbsp;
The vegetation of this shingly plain is much the same, Chenopodium,
<i>Ukko</i>, Salsola, <i>Kureel</i>, <i>Rairoo</i>; the most common
shrubby plant, however, is an elegant Mimosa, much like the <i>Babool</i>,
with white thorns; Nerium oleander is also very common along cuts.</p>
<p>In some wheat fields I procured Imperata, a new Plantago, and a curious
Gnaphalium.&nbsp; The entrance to the pass is gradual; the hills almost
entirely bare.&nbsp; I noticed <i>Rairoo</i>, Salvadora, <i>Kureel</i>.&nbsp;
The most novel plant is a curious, erect, bushy, thorny Convolvulus,
which is one of the most common plants farther in.&nbsp; The pass to
Drubbee is wide, say 300 yards; the only obstacle exists in the shingle,
which renders the road heavy.&nbsp; No abutments are present, jutting
out from the hills, the stream is considerable but easily fordable,
and abounds with fish, the Mahaseer, and two or three species of Gonorhynchus.&nbsp;
The hills about Drubbee are not more than 500 feet high.&nbsp; They
are generally of a coarse breccia, the component parts principally limestone;
abundance of nummulites.&nbsp; The chief vegetation of the pass is one
or two Andropogoneous grasses, and Apocynum nerioides.&nbsp; There is
absolutely no fodder for camels, which however, take readily to grass.&nbsp;
Towards the mouth of the pass, P&aelig;deria involucrata, Villarsia,
Lycioid, Stenophyllum and <i>Ukko</i> are common, but they are rare
inside, although the last continues some distance up the hills and attains
a large size, becoming quite arboreous.&nbsp; A Crucifera, a rhubarby
sorrel, a Goodyera, and one or two grasses, were the only additional
novelties met with.</p>
<p><i>12th</i>.&mdash;Marched on eight miles, after five of which we
turned to the right, and the pass became and continued narrow, until
we reached our halting place, which is something like what we may suppose
to be the remains of a mountain, still a good deal elevated above the
bed of river.&nbsp; The mountains continued the same in the gorge, until
we came to limestone cliffs, which afforded a peculiar vegetation, Linaria
retephioides, Linaria alia pusilla foliis 5-gonis cordatis, floribus
luteis minutis pubescens, specimen lost, one or two Rubiace&aelig;,
a Salvia, several very interesting grasses, among which is a Stipa,
a Composita, Santanoides, a curious Capparidea, Cassia, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The hills have increased in height, in many places they were extremely
picturesque, split and divided in every direction.&nbsp; The valley
running off to south on our entrance into the gorge: river diminished
somewhat in size.&nbsp; Jheely spots, with very deep water common, surrounded
with thick Andropogon, Typha and Scirpus jungle.&nbsp; Few fish were
seen and none taken.&nbsp; Can the Mahaseer not reach this?&nbsp; Gonorhynchus
continue, but they never take a fly; Ophiocephalus, <i>Sowlee</i>; turtle
caught by bearers, Silurus.&nbsp; No less than twenty-three plants novel
to me were gathered on the limestone, which looks as bare as the breccia;
all its plants grew in small tufts or singly, and all adhered firmly
to the rock.&nbsp; The only tree which continues is <i>Phulahi</i> or
<i>Rairoo</i>; Convolvulus spinosus very common, a very curious Chenopodioid,
Reseda with Cruciferous qualities.</p>
<p><i>13th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Gurmab, eight and a half miles.&nbsp;
Country continues the same.&nbsp; The defile after crossing some rather
broad water three feet deep, opened out into a rather large valley,
near the south end of which Gurmab is situated, and it is <i>ornamented</i>
with a good many <i>Rairoo</i> trees, of indifferent size and appearance.&nbsp;
No change whatever in the vegetation; Salsola prima occurs sparingly.</p>
<p><i>14th</i>.&mdash;Halted at Gurmab.&nbsp; The hills close to our
encampment are of limestone, which is in many places very angular.&nbsp;
Oolite found by Durand in a low range, standing by itself in the valley,
it generally bears a vast quantity of nummulites and madrepores.&nbsp;
A flat discoid organized remain occurs in abundance, and probably belongs
to the same group.&nbsp; <i>Ukko</i>, <i>Rairoo</i>, <i>Kureel</i> rare,
Convolvulus spinosus, Frankenioides, Stipaceum gramen, Euphorbia, Polygonum
rheoides, Salvadora, may be found.&nbsp; Along the water Andropogonoides
2, Typha, Arundo, Juncus, Scirpus juncinus in abundance.&nbsp; In the
water, a new Naias, and Conferve&aelig;.&nbsp; In a ravine near our
camp, I found a Cynoglossum and a curious Periploceous plant, in habit
approaching to certain Aphyllous, true Asclepiads.</p>
<p>A few stunted dates are visible near Gurmab, which is three miles
from Kirtah, and towards the deep water there is a ruin of a single
house.&nbsp; <i>Rairoo</i>, Nerioid, and Lycium albidum are the most
common ground plants.&nbsp; There is only <i>Rairoo</i> for camels,
who do not thrive on harsh grasses, although compelled by hunger to
eat them.&nbsp; Large flocks of Doombah sheep and goats belonging to
Khelat men were met with.&nbsp; Mahaseer in abundance, and very greedy
after a red hackle of fish, Macrognathus and Opheocephalus occur also.&nbsp;
Of birds the white vulture, Alauda cristata et alia, with a notched
beak, a partridge which I had not previously seen, Motacilla alia.</p>
<p><i>15th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Beebee Nanee, nine and a half miles
up the valley in which Gurmab is situated.&nbsp; The road tolerably
level and good; boulders not however common.&nbsp; The village of Kuttah,
is one mile to the right, consisting of one ruined house; near the exit
from the valley a burial ground occurs, having flags, or banners, pointing
out the graves, which are covered with heaps of stones.&nbsp; The exit
from the valley is by a narrow pass through a low range of angular limestone,
thence up another narrow shingly valley or narrowish gorge, and over
a small stream of water of ordinary temperature, where we encamped:
in the second valley two spots were observed covered with graves.&nbsp;
Immense flocks of birds were seen on the range to the west of the valley.&nbsp;
In the first valley P&aelig;deria involucrata and Salsola prima, are
the most common plants.&nbsp; On the limestone hills, Convolvulus spinosus,
Frankeniacea, Plantago villosa, and a curious Composita, subacaulis,
involucro foliaceo, of which the single specimen has been lost, a few
<i>Bheirs</i>.</p>
<p>Encamped in a small valley or pass leading to Khelat, a marked one
only a few hundred yards wide.&nbsp; To the west, the hills continue
very barren.&nbsp; Gurmab&mdash;this takes its name from the warmth
of the water, which apparently rises in several sedgy spots; the united
waters form a small stream abounding with Mahaseer, Barbus, etc. and
falling into another stream, again meets the main river, which runs
off to the eastward from the place where it is crossed towards Gurmab.&nbsp;
There is no sign of bubbling in the springs, although the water commences
to run visibly from within a few yards.&nbsp; The temperature of one
did not vary from 76&deg;, which must be about the mean temperature
of the place, but the temperature of a deep body of water after the
confluence of several springs was 82&deg;, so that some of them must
hence be of considerable temperature: the highest examined was 81&deg;.</p>
<p>Of three springs examined&mdash;the first of these had a temperature
of 82&deg; Fahr.&mdash;the second of 77&deg;, these unite to form the
streamlet that runs towards the east&mdash;the third spring had a temperature
of 77&deg;: this is crossed on entering the valley from the south, it
runs under a limestone range, and then bends off to the south-east to
unite with the main stream.&nbsp; Cyprinus fulgens and C. bimaculatus
were found in the 82&deg; spring.&nbsp; From the variation in the temperature
of the three, it is obvious that neither represents the mean temperature
of the place.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;To Abigoom, eight and a quarter miles, through
a similar country up a valley in a NNW. direction; the valley is narrowed
towards the middle, and is a plain of considerable inclination, the
chief rocks passed are limestones.&nbsp; No fodder for camels, and little
enough on the road for horses; the chief vegetation consisting of Nerioides,
P&aelig;deria involucrata, and small tufts of <i>Kuss</i>-<i>kuss</i>
grass; Ruwash is common, Lycium album; Salsola prima are not common,
and the <i>Bheir</i> is rare.&nbsp; A new and curious plant looking
like <i>Kureel</i> was found, male flowers with large semi-antheriferous
bearing disc.&nbsp; Apocynum viminale not uncommon, and not ruined by
cattle, Prenanthoid albiflora, Echinopsides, a fine Begonia, B. punicoides,
arbuscula; Salvadora also occurred.&nbsp; The inclined valleys are very
shingly and bouldery.&nbsp; The mountains as barren as ever.</p>
<p>There is at Beebee Nanee a running streamlet, in which small Mahaseer,
Nepuroid, Gonorhynchus and Barbus may be found; also a species of Cancer.&nbsp;
We were encamped close to the cliffy termination of a limestone range,
in which Linaria, Trichodesma, Cynoglossum, Ruwash, Labiata, and a most
singular Telepheoid polygalous looking plant were found.&nbsp; There
is some fodder along the water for horses, but for camels scarcely any:
we accordingly lose six to ten camels now daily.&nbsp; There was a curious
echo from the cliff.</p>
<p><i>17th</i>.&mdash;To-day we halt at Abigoom, which is at the extremity
of an inclined plain, and 2,500 feet above the sea; some of the boundary
hills are considerably higher, the valley is shingly and bouldery, covered
with the usual plants, but more scantily: Nerioid, P&aelig;deria involucrata,
Lycium albidium, Apocynum viminale.</p>
<p>I went to some wheat cultivation yesterday afternoon about two and
a half miles off, in a small valley to the south-east.&nbsp; The wheat
was fine, all bearded, most of the Dadur plant occurred in it with some
curious novelties, Boraginea, Cynoglossum, Composit&aelig;, Cuscuta,
and a new Reseda.&nbsp; The Melilotus and red Anchusoid were not found,
Plantago, were among the most abundant.&nbsp; A single <i>Furas</i>
tree and some <i>Kureel</i> were seen near the wheat.&nbsp; The weather
unsettled; cloudy; rain fell at night and early this morning.&nbsp;
A <i>cafilah</i> or caravan from Candahar with figs and raisins passed
us.&nbsp; Rock pigeon of Loodianah and the small partridge were observed.&nbsp;
There is a streamlet here.</p>
<p><i>18th</i>.&mdash;Detained by bad weather, which threatened the
whole of yesterday.&nbsp; The river came down during the night, flooded,
and upset some of the tents, damaging many things, but not carrying
off much.&nbsp; It rained smartly almost the whole night: we moved this
morning to rather higher ground, but not so high as to preclude all
danger should the river rise again.&nbsp; A dawk man arrived last night,
bringing a handful of tulips which he said came from Shal; it is a small
species, foliis subtortis undulatis caule 1-flora, flore amplo aureo
subodora.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;Advanced to Sirekhugoor, distance nineteen miles,
ascent throughout on a considerably inclined plain up the bed of a river,
shingly and bouldery; the pass is not much contracted, but a short distance
from Abigoom we parted from every thing like valleys.&nbsp; The vegetation
continues much the same: <i>Kureel</i>, Salsola prima re-occurred near
Abigoom but sparingly, chief vegetation consists of clumps of withered
coarse Andropogons, Nerioides, P&aelig;deria, and Lycium, but less common
than before, while Apocynum viminale, and Convolvulus spinosus have
increased.&nbsp; The bed of the streamlet is until near Sirekhugoor,
chiefly occupied by a large Arundo just past flowering, in which Typha
also occurs sparingly: within 300 feet of the halting place, a solitary
<i>Khujoor</i>, and some wheat cultivation occurs, the latter much behind
that of Abigoom.&nbsp; In the fields Polygala occurred with a Galium;
the most common plant being a Sinapis found at Dadur: some <i>Bheir</i>
trees also occur here; a few Composit&aelig;, Labiat&aelig;, and Crucifer&aelig;,
similar to those at Abigoom, are also found: the novelties were <i>Peganum</i>
which continues throughout the pass, Hyoscyamoid, and one or two Composit&aelig;;
while in water-courses close to it the first dripping rocks occurred
covered with Adiantum and fructiferous mosses, and a curious Primuloid
plant out of flower, with a curious Clematis.</p>
<p>The halting place is at the head of the stream, which gushes copiously
out of a rock; the bed of the river or defile is 100 yards wide: the
mountains immediately adjoining not exceeding 1,000 feet in height,
but the second range is much higher, that to our north being plentifully
sprinkled with snow.&nbsp; These mountains are barren, chiefly covered
with Convolvulus spinosus, which has a different aspect, with a Sytisoid,
handsome silvery shrub, a species of Caragana and Apocynum viminale:
about the spring and in other places there are thick patches of a very
dwarf palm, and a solitary fig tree, a Lycium album continues: the bed
occupied by tufts of coarse Andropogons and Apocynum viminale; about
the spring Adiantum, a small Boraginia, white flowered small Composit&aelig;,
a withered Hepaticum, two or three efructiferous mosses, and the Primuloid
plant.&nbsp; In the stream Chara, Conferva, Peppermint, <i>Beccabunga</i>,
Convolvulus, like C. reptans, Arundo left behind nearly.&nbsp; On the
mountains fragrant Labiat&aelig;, Composit&aelig;, and Umbellifer&aelig;
are commencing.&nbsp; The barometer stood at 25.669; thermometer 64&deg;
at 11 A.M.&nbsp; Many soft rocks occurred: passed a clayey looking one,
with very elevated strata, containing veins of transverse crystals:
the sides of the defile are often precipitous, these are generally formed
of conglomerate.</p>
<p><i>20th</i>.&mdash;Continued up the same defile, a gradual ascent,
and about two miles from Sirekhugoor entered the pass by pre-eminence;
very much narrowed, precipitous cliffs on both sides: this continues
for some time.&nbsp; The road good, shingly, but not very bouldery;
very winding, and generally capable of strong defence; much cover exists
from the rugged margins of cliffs, and windings of the road.&nbsp; The
mountains, after four or five miles were passed, gradually receded and
became less precipitous: at length we came to gradually rounded more
distant mountains; then to a small valley; then ascended say 100 feet,
over a low rocky range, and descended into a fine valley, surrounded
by usual barren looking mountains: high ranges to the north and south
covered with snow presenting a beautiful view&mdash;and now entered
Khorassan.&nbsp; We were accompanied by several bands of a gypsyish-looking
people, forming parts of a <i>cafilah</i>.&nbsp; They were accompanied
with numerous goats: and camels ornamented with trappings.</p>
<p>Throughout the very narrow portion of the pass the vegetation continues
the same: at Sirekhugoor a Xanthoxylon appears and continues nearly
throughout: this and an oleinous looking small tree are the only arborescent
plants: Apocynum viminale and the other plants of Sirekhugoor continue,
nor did I notice any new ones further than a Sedum, and Tortula.&nbsp;
However fragrant Labiat&aelig; and Composit&aelig; increase in number,
but none are in flower.</p>
<p>As soon as we opened out from the pass, the vegetation almost entirely
changed; the hills assumed a rounded form, covered with low bushes,
and were much less rocky.&nbsp; Umbellifer&aelig;, Labiat&aelig;, and
Composit&aelig; abound, some of them deliciously fragrant: an Astragaloid
spinosus very common, a shrubby Cerasus, Thalictrum, Hypoxis, and small
Crucifer&aelig; abundant.&nbsp; The chief vegetation consists of grasses
in low round tufts; Anemone, Tulipa, etc. all small.&nbsp; After crossing
a low range we came into the valley, which is almost entirely covered
with an Artemisioid odoriferous plant; no verdure was visible, even
on the snowy ranges.&nbsp; We encamped close under a ridge about two
and a half miles to the north of the summit of the pass.</p>
<p><i>21st</i>.&mdash;Halted: there being some water collected in attempts
to form a nullah from the last rain, it is quite brownish and opaque,
but deposits no sediment, and makes good tea, although disagreeable
to drink in any other form.&nbsp; I walked out in the afternoon into
a valley to the west, close to our encampment, and thence ascended a
hill 600 feet high at least.</p>
<p>This valley like the one in which we are encamped is covered entirely
by an Artemisioid, a very fragrant plant, each shrub of which is distinct;
mixed with it are tulips, several small Crucifer&aelig;, and a Fritillarioides.</p>
<p>The same Artemisioid is also the chief plant on all the hills: it
is mixed, but in small quantities with Cerasus pygm&aelig;us, Equisetoid,
Caragana, and one or two shrubby Labiat&aelig;; and also especially
above, with a curious Astragaloid looking plant.&nbsp; The herbaceous
plants are numerous, consisting of very fragrant Umbellifer&aelig;,
bursting into leaf; tulips, Fritillarioides, Trichostema, Erodium, Iris,
Thalictrum, Senecio, Boragine&aelig; 2, Gilenacea, several tufted Gramine&aelig;,
Berberide&aelig;, Ranunculoides, Myosotis, Anemone cracea, Asphodeloid,
Mesembryanthoids; of mosses Tortula, Grimmia.</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Sinab, a distance of fifteen and
three quarter miles, up two valleys, no ascents.&nbsp; These valleys
are elevated towards the mountains and generally depressed in the centre:
in some they stretch out a long way from the mountain to which they
may be imagined to belong.&nbsp; The mountains seen from a distance
jutting out from perhaps the centre of a plain, look curious.&nbsp;
The vegetation is generally Artemisioid, and very fragrant: the first
valley in its depressed portions was covered with a Salsoloid looking
plant, to the exclusion of Composit&aelig;, but these last recurred
in the higher parts.</p>
<p>With the Composit&aelig;, swarms of small Crucifer&aelig; occur;
that with purple flowers and pinnatisect leaves being the most common.&nbsp;
Very rugged hills are visible to the north-east and north of our route,
presenting a very different appearance from the usual aspect: they are
steep to the east, and present inclined slopes to the west.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>24th</i>.&mdash;Halted this day.&nbsp; Little new
occurs in the valley, except a few trees out of leaf and flower, which,
though trees here, yet the species are not so elsewhere.&nbsp; At this
place are the heads of the river of Pisheen, which appear to arise more
artificially than naturally from <i>Kahreezes</i>, or wells dug in a
rude way, and communicating by subterranean channels; those nearest
the natural outlet of the water being the shallowest.&nbsp; The vegetation
is the same; there is a little cultivation, but nothing to indicate
any descent.&nbsp; The amount of population is not great; and the hills
to the west are covered with snow.&nbsp; The chief vegetation is <i>Santonica</i>.&nbsp;
In cornfields Fumariace&aelig;, Adonis, Crucifer&aelig;, Pulmonaria,
Arenaria, Hordei sp., Tulipa lutea, and Hyacinthus? may be found.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the plains, inclusive of Santonica, consists generally
of three or four small Crucifer&aelig;, Tulipa lutea.</p>
<p>I went to the west towards the snow, and found in the river here
an aquatic Ranunculus, foliis omnibus immersis, floribus albis, Chara
is common; gravelly slopes commence some distance from hills, covered
with Santonica, Astragaloid spinosus, Leguminos&aelig;, a spinous Statice,
Cytisus argenteis, Composita floribunda carnosa.</p>
<p>The mountains are covered with masses of rock.&nbsp; One tree occurs
with a Fraxinus? a Thymeleous looking shrub, Cytisus, Caragana.&nbsp;
The herbaceous plants are very numerous, Composit&aelig;, Crucifer&aelig;,
small Leguminos&aelig;, Berberide&aelig;, Isopyroides, Crocus? Gentiana,
Onosma and other Boragine&aelig;, Umbellifer&aelig;, Silenace&aelig;,
especially small Arenari&aelig;; Cupressus commences about 6,500 feet,
near the Cypress an Arctium occurred, at least it has the habit of that
genus, Onosma, a curious Boraginea calyce sinubus bidentigeris, demum
plano! ampliato bilabiato! clauso, quasi hastato lobato, nucibus compressis,
2, Sedums 4, Arenari&aelig;, a fine Gentiana, Crocoides, Iris, Ornithogaloides
or Trichonema occurred, with many others.&nbsp; The greatest elevation
attained was about 1,200 feet above the camp.&nbsp; Chikor and the smaller
partridge were seen.</p>
<p><i>25th</i>.&mdash;Marched to Quettah, eight and a half miles up
the valley over a delightful road.&nbsp; The valley is cultivated, and
many villages are visible with their orchards, consisting of mulberry
trees, cherries, and apricots, surrounded with mud walls; the houses
miserable, and all trees out of leaf: the crops under cultivation are
more advanced, but depend on irrigation, some salad-bearing plant occurred
cultivated in trenches like asparagus: the fields are clean, and sometimes
well manured.&nbsp; A Veronica allied to V. agrestis, 2 or 3 Euphorbiace&aelig;,
a very well defined Plantago, Hyacinthus, and a pretty Muscari, were
among the novelties; Juncus, Chara, Carex, occurred in some marshy spots.&nbsp;
I was most struck with the occurrence of at least two species of Lucerne,
or Trefoil: wells are common, and water abundant.&nbsp; The climate
is delightful, temperature 49&deg; at 9 P.M. in a tent.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;I ascended towards a snowy range to the ESE. of
our camp, crossing a cultivated portion of the valley extending to the
gradual slopes so universal between the level portion and the bases
of the mountains, and which are always covered with shingle, and occasionally
much cut up by watercourses.&nbsp; Turning a ridge I ascended up a ravine,
rather wide and easy at first, but becoming gradually narrow, and at
last difficult.&nbsp; On coming to its head I rambled some distance
higher among precipitous rocks, the ground generally covered with loose
shingle, giving bad footing.&nbsp; The rocks too were treacherous, often
giving way under the feet.&nbsp; I was still 1,000 feet from the summit,
which is the second range between our camp and the snow but which is
not visible from the camp.&nbsp; From it I saw the camp, and the valley
of Pisheen beyond the termination of the Tuckatoo range.&nbsp; Water
boiled at 196&deg; 7', making the height about 8,300 feet, in my (new)
Woollaston instrument at 686; temperature of the air 46&deg; 5'.&nbsp;
Nothing occurred to repay me for the fatigue of the excursion.&nbsp;
Junipers or cypress form the chief arbusculous vegetation, but even
these are scanty; they commence at 6,500 feet, and continue to the snow:
Fraxinus occurred about 7,000 feet, and another tree of which I could
make nothing, it being out of flower and leaf.&nbsp; Composit&aelig;
were the prevailing vegetation; but of these, only the remains were
found, which were very fragrant.&nbsp; A large thorny Leguminous shrub
out of leaf, etc. looking much like a Rosa, Equisetoides, etc.; of mosses,
Weissia Templetonii, and Tortula, so that in these there is very little
variety; the debris of one Hepatica occurred.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountains, the only place out of the valley where
any vegetation is to be found, Asphodelus, radicibus luteis, foliis
triangularibus, a fine plant coming into flower, Cytisus, Caragana,
Narcissus? Crucifer&aelig;, among them a small Draba, Cerasus pygm&aelig;us,
Peganum, Salsoloid of Mumzil, Trichonema, Myosotis, Gentiana of Chiltera,
Buddl&aelig;a, Carex; indeed the vegetation is precisely the same as
at Chiltera.&nbsp; The only novelty was Bardana in flower, and it proves
to be a cruciferous plant of large size.</p>
<p>On the stony slopes, a shrubby spinous Centauroid, foliis pinnatifidis
glaucis, Cytisus, Caragana, Asphodelus and Cheiranthus are the prevailing
plants.&nbsp; No Santonica is found about here.</p>
<p>A new Iris occurs in abundance: near this in wettish parts of the
valley a Vicia, Muscari, Hyacinthus and others as before.&nbsp; The
chief cultivation is wheat, irrigated in plots: the soil when saturated
with water, forming a clayish, adhesive, finely pulverulent mass, which
cakes on drying.&nbsp; A watermill for flour, having a horizontal wheel
acted on by the stream as in Bootan occurs; the grain drops in from
a pyramidal cone fixed over the two horizontal stones, in the upper
of which there is a hole.&nbsp; The apparatus is very rude.</p>
<p>The height attained by me on the eastern ridge being about 8,300
feet; that of the 2nd range, will be 9,300 feet at least, and the height
of the peak or highest ridge, cannot be less than 11,000 feet.</p>
<p>30th.&mdash;Continue to halt.&nbsp; There is a good deal of cultivation
about this place, but the crops will not be ripe before August: it is
principally wheat; munjit is also cultivated on trenched ground: the
young sprouts have a good salad-like flavour.&nbsp; The Suddozye Lora
runs through the valley, about two miles from the town: it is a small
stream, crowded here and there with bulrushes, sedges, etc.&nbsp; Towards
its banks there is a good deal of Santonica, but elsewhere there is
no good fodder, and wherever this is the case the camels eat Iris, and
destroy themselves.&nbsp; The valley is sprinkled over with villages
and orchards, and is picturesque enough.&nbsp; In one spot, where water
runs over the surface, it is delightfully green and velvety, covered
with short grass and trefoil, Carex, etc.</p>
<p>In cornfields in this direction, Berberidea ranunculiflora is very
common, Muscari, Hyacinthus, Taraxacum, Plantago.&nbsp; Of animals the
Jerboa, sent to Macleod by Mr. Mackenzie, of the Artillery, several
specimens having been caught here: presenting affinities obviously with
the hare, and analogies with the Kangaroo.&nbsp; Macleod has just given
me, from his namesake of the 3rd Cavalry, a tadpole-like animal, very
similar to one from the Khasiya Hills.&nbsp; I fear it is a tadpole,
but I keep the specimen lest it should be a Lepidosiren.</p>
<p>The orchards here consist of cherry, and a pomaceous tree which also
is cultivated at Shikarpore, and on the skirts occasionally of willows,
which, were they unmutilated, would be handsome trees.&nbsp; The Punjabi
name of the pomaceous one is <i>Sai</i>-<i>oo</i>, of the cherry or
plum <i>Aloochah</i>.</p>
<p>Senecionoid glauca is extremely common towards the river, but is
not eaten by camels.&nbsp; In the streams arising from springs a Myriophylloides
is very common; as also in some places, Ranunculus aquaticus, Beccabunga,
Mentha piperitioid, a Sicyoid, Juncus, Conifer&aelig;, and Carice&aelig;,
all small.</p>
<p>Along the banks of the river, there is a good deal of a small thorny
shrub with white bark and fleshy clavato-spathulate leaves.&nbsp; Themopsis
is extremely common, Crucifera glauca ditto, Peganum less so, Achilleoides
is very common.&nbsp; In damp spots a Lotus (out of flower) occurs.&nbsp;
The ground is covered in many places with an efflorescence of saltpetre.</p>
<p><i>Quettah</i>.&mdash;The country was so disturbed throughout the
greater part of the line, and attacks on followers so frequent, that
I did not go out so much during the last few days as I otherwise would.&nbsp;
The only plant that seems to a considerable extent local, is the larger
Asphodel, which is however found occasionally towards Kuchlak.&nbsp;
Within the last few days vegetation has rapidly progressed; the orchards
bursting into leaf, and the whole plain, where uncultivated, is assuming
a greenish tint.&nbsp; I have nothing to add respecting the botany,
except having found Ceratophyllum and two species of Chara, one a very
interesting species from having the joints furnished with semi-reflexed,
very narrow leaves, it is apparently Dioeceous, there is also a Naiad,
much like that found at Dadur.&nbsp; No Lemn&aelig; occur among the
vegetation: there is some sort of pea cultivated: but the chief object
is wheat, then next to it in extent is Lucerne, which is cultivated
in plots; the ground being laid out as in wheat, so as to allow of irrigation.</p>
<p>The climate is variable; rain generally falls every four or five
days, before this happens it becomes hot and hazy, afterwards it is
very cold and clear: the alternations are hence very great.&nbsp; From
the thermometer immersed in the fount of a spring gushing out from a
<i>Kabreeza</i>, the mean temperature would appear to be 56&deg;.&nbsp;
Water running in cuts close to it, was 66&deg;.&nbsp; A Tauschia occurs
in abundance near the spot, and is remarkable for illustrating the nature
of the leaves of the upper parts; it is curious that all such have a
peculiar aspect.&nbsp; (For other plants of this neighbourhood, see
Cat. and Icones.)</p>
<p>The town although the third in Khorassan, is a miserable place and
has a deserted aspect, the houses are of the most temporary construction,
and the hill is crowned by a poor half-ruined <i>kucha</i> fort; the
gates of the town are ornamented with wild goats&rsquo; horns and heads.&nbsp;
There is no trade, and the place is stated to be plundered often by
Caukers.&nbsp; Orchards&mdash;apricots of large size, and very large
cherry trees, a pomaceous plant with the habit of poplar, occurs; the
Ulmus of this place is one of the largest sized trees; no walnuts.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;Left Quettah for Kuchlak.&nbsp; We
traversed the sandy plain and then ascended the gravelly slope to the
pass traversed before reaching Kuchlak, the ascent and descent were
about equal, but the former was long and gradual, the latter rapid and
short.&nbsp; The features of the country are precisely the same; the
pass is short, the descent to the ravine, which in the rains is evidently
a watercourse, short and steep, not 100 feet.&nbsp; The mountains forming
the sides are steep; and those to the left, bold and romantic, with
here and there a small tree.&nbsp; The plain of Kuchlak is like that
of Quettah, well supplied with water-cuts and one small canal, but miserably
cultivated, and with very few villages.&nbsp; The hills forming its
west boundary are low, rugged, and curiously variegated with red and
white.&nbsp; Tuckatoo forms part of its eastern boundary: no snow is
visible on its face towards Kuchlak: a few low rounded hillocks occur
in the centre of the valley.&nbsp; The chief vegetation round the camp,
is Santonica.&nbsp; We encamped close to the western boundary of the
valley, about two miles from the grand camp: total distance of the march
thirteen and a half miles.&nbsp; The climate is very hot and variable;
thermometer ranged to-day from 40&deg; to 86&deg;.</p>
<p>The chief vegetation of the gravelly slopes is as marked as ever,
and differs entirely from that of the sandy tillable portion; it consists
of Centaurea fruticosa, C. spinosa, Anthylloides or Ononoides, Astragalus
spinosus, and Staticoides, another thorny Composita occurs, but is not
common, the herbaceous plants are Crucifer&aelig; in large numbers,
as well as Composit&aelig;; of Boragine&aelig;, a good many, some Labiat&aelig;,
a large Salvia: towards the tillable lands or where gravelly places
occur among these, Asphodelus is common with Cheiranthus; one or more
fruticose Dianthi occur in these places, and a curious shrubby Polygonum.</p>
<p>In dry watercourses Cytisus is common, with a host of small Crucifer&aelig;,
Boragine&aelig;, and Composit&aelig;; Papaverace&aelig; are very common
with Glaucium.</p>
<p>The novelties in the pass were Ficus, Lycium, some grasses, Onosma.&nbsp;
(See Cat. from Nos. 411 to 430,) Marchantiace&aelig;.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Hydozee, distance eight miles.&nbsp;
The country is very barren, diversified by curious low hills, of a red,
white, or yellowish colour, divided by small bits of plain, which in
some cases were a good deal cut up by ravines.&nbsp; Passed immediately
on starting, the Sudoozye Lora, here a sluggish muddy stream, knee-deep,
twenty yards wide, and in addition to a bad dry cut, we passed likewise
another little stream with a pebbly bottom and rapid current.</p>
<p>The crops composing the very little cultivation seen before arriving,
were backward and scanty: so were those at Hydozee.&nbsp; The chief
vegetation is Santonica; here and there are gravelly spots with Centaurea
fruticosa, spinosa; Statice, Salvia, etc. re-occur.&nbsp; The commonest
shrub along the watercourses is Lycium, with another Lycioid thorny
plant.</p>
<p>The low hills were in some cases stratified, the strata in others
and perhaps in most were indistinct: most were rounded, but the outlines
at a distance were very diversified.&nbsp; The novelties today were
a fine vesicular calyxed Astragalus, an Isatidea, tulip of red, orange,
and yellow, indiscriminately mixed, Papaver Rheas, Cheiranthus lapidium,
Asphodels both sorts, but the second and larger one is uncommon, Iris
<i>Stacyana</i> very common in sandy places, Iris agrestis, most common
about Suddozye, Adonis, and Ranunculus Anemoides occurs.&nbsp; Snow
on north side of Tuckatoo mountain as heavy as on Chiltera; the valley
of Pisheen is here a miserable place, narrower than that of Quettah.</p>
<p><i>9th</i>.&mdash;Advanced to Hykulzyea, distance twelve miles to
the town, about eleven through a similar country with that previously
noted, and until the expanded part of the valley of Pisheen is entered
the aspect is very barren; the road extends between low rounded hills.&nbsp;
After crossing the valley of Hydozyea, three streams are passed, none
of any size.&nbsp; Botanical features continue the same, Santonica being
still the prevailing plant.&nbsp; The curious frutex pluvinatus of Sinab
re-occurred, together with an additional subspiny Astragaloid shrub
and a small Ruta.&nbsp; The hills are covered with distinct small shrubs,
never coalescing into patches.&nbsp; Peganum continues in addition to
the other plants: Glaucioides has aqueous juice, Papaver Rheas ditto,
the other smooth-leaved one has it slightly milky.</p>
<p>Lycium and Tamarisk 4-fida is rather common: Hykulzyea is a far larger
place than Quettah, but miserably defended.&nbsp; The houses are very
inferior, consisting of thatch and mud.&nbsp; The cultivation of wheat
is rather extensive around.&nbsp; Many villages are seen towards the
hills to the north and NNE.; also one or two forts, but not a tree is
to be seen in the valley which is comparatively very large and very
level.&nbsp; The hills to the north have the ordinary appearance; those
separating us from the valley of Hydozyea, more especially the lower
ranges, are so confused that they look like a chopping sea, and present
a red and white colour.&nbsp; The rock pigeon of Loodianah is common
about Hydozyea.&nbsp; A few novelties occurred in the vegetation, the
chief of which being a large Salvoid Labiata, a plant which is very
common throughout Khorassan from Sinab in gravelly spots.&nbsp; Leguminos&aelig;,
Boragine&aelig;, Composit&aelig;, Crucifer&aelig;, and Labiat&aelig;,
are the prevailing plants; Salsola tertia not uncommon.&nbsp; Birds
as before, Alauda cristata, and Sylvioides being the most common; no
red legged crows were seen.&nbsp; Rock pigeons are abundant.</p>
<p><i>10th</i>.&mdash;March to Berumby, distance thirteen miles, the
road very bad in one or two places: the first difficulty being a rather
deep ravine, the second a nullah, with water knee-deep, and very high
precipitous banks, yet both these had to be passed.&nbsp; Much of the
baggage was not up at the encampment until 5 P.M., although we started
at 3 A.M., but the nullah was literally choked up with camels.&nbsp;
No change in the vegetation has appeared, except in the occurrence of
large tracts of Tamarisk, which tree reaches to nearly the same size
as the <i>Jhow</i>.&nbsp; Very little cultivation is to be seen; the
villages are tolerably numerous, especially near the hills forming the
north boundary of the valley.</p>
<p><i>11th</i>.&mdash;Entered the pass which is at first wide, with
a gradual ascent, but which soon becomes narrowish, with a good though
gradual and easy ascent: the mountains are of no height, and they are
not generally precipitous: no limestone, but much clay slate occurs.&nbsp;
The ravine up which we passed, or rather watercourse, was well stocked
with Xanthoxylon, some of large size as to the diameter of trunk, but
very stumpy: water is found not far from the entrance: some cultivation
also occurs and one large walled village, Dera Abdoollah Khan, lay to
our left.&nbsp; Not much change in the vegetation: Xanthoxylon is almost
entirely confined to ravines, Cerasus common, and one or two other prickly
shrubs, and a Ruta, Onosma, Linarea, coming into flower, are among the
novelties.</p>
<p>We encamped where the pass becomes narrow, and the ascent steep,
and where water is plentiful, but the stream being soon absorbed does
not appear to run down the main ravine at this season.</p>
<p><i>12th</i>.&mdash;Halted, to make the road where the main ascent
commences about 400 yards from our camp, and which is about 300 feet
high; thence there is a descent, and afterwards an ascent to about 600
feet above the camp, whence the <i>low</i> plains of Candahar are visible,
as well as the range to the north of which Candahar stands.&nbsp; The
road is good compared with places elsewhere to be seen, and for common
traffic on camels may be easy enough; but for guns, it is steep and
difficult.&nbsp; The way it has been made by the Engineers is admirable
and rapid; three other passes without roads, and in their rude natural
state are as yet to be crossed.&nbsp; The pass here is narrow, none
of the hills rise more than 1,000 feet above it, they are easily accessible,
and are composed chiefly of clay slate.&nbsp; Chikores are frequent.&nbsp;
The cuckoo was heard to-day, as well as a beautifully melodious titmouse,
with a black crown: a fine eagle, or falcon was seen.</p>
<p>The hills are as usual barren, all the shrubs are thorny, and all
the plants unsocial, never coalescing into any thing like groups.&nbsp;
The Xanthoxylon is found throughout in ravines up to nearly 7,000 feet,
the utmost height of the pass.&nbsp; Fraxmus of Chiltera also occurs,
Cerasus primus, in abundance, Cerasus alius, tertius, not uncommon,
Berberis! here and there in ravines, Equisetoides, Caraganoides altera;
the most common shrubs of any size are Cerasus primus.&nbsp; The other
shrubs consist of the low customary Composit&aelig;, and Astragale&aelig;,
Umbellifer&aelig; are common, among which last the Nari, a species of
Assaf&oelig;tida occurs?&nbsp; A beautiful Iris is common, as well as
tufts of Berberide&aelig;, Asphodelus major, and which is much eaten
when cooked as a <i>turkaree</i> by our hungry followers, Eryngioides,
Aconitoides, a Valeriana, three new small Veronic&aelig;, small Crucifer&aelig;,
Silenace&aelig;, Boragine&aelig;, and Labiat&aelig;, form the bulk of
the herbaceous vegetation.&nbsp; An Arenarioid, Muscoid, Crucifer&aelig;,
common at the head of the pass.&nbsp; A large Acanthoid leaved Umbellifera,
a Rheoides papillis verrucosum, this is a true Rheum, and when cultivated
becomes the <i>Ruwash</i> of the Affghanistans; it is very common on
the Candahar face of the pass, particularly about Chokey, where it is
in flower.</p>
<p><i>13th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Chokey, not quite four miles.&nbsp;
The top of the pass may be reached by three or four passes.&nbsp; I
went by one to the right, which is easy enough, and the descent from
which is much better adapted for camels than the made road, which is
very steep, with two sharp turns, but soft.&nbsp; The descent thence
is gradual, down one of the ordinary ravines, well clothed with the
usual shrubs and Xanthoxylon: our camels were a good deal fagged, but
more from the halt at the pass, where some cathartic plant abounds and
weakens them very much, than fatigue.&nbsp; The view from the top of
the pass is very extensive: the plains are seen to have nearly the same
level, and are divided here and there very frequently to north-east
and north, by the ordinary mountains.</p>
<p><i>14th</i>.&mdash;Halt; water here is not abundant, and is obtained
from driblets and pools; around these, the surface is covered with a
rich sward, which affords fine fodder for a small number of horses.&nbsp;
In the swampy spots, <i>Beccabunga</i>, Anagallis, Mentha, Carex, Glaux,
apparently identical (so far as a memory of 7 years may be trusted,)
with the English plant, the small variety of Leontodon, Medicaginoides,
Phleum, and the very small Amaranthoid, Polygonea, occur.</p>
<p>The hills around Chokey, and below it are rounded, those towards
the pass being more steep.&nbsp; They are covered with Centaurea fruticosa,
and C. spinosa, a favourite food of camels when it has young shoots,
Santonica, Statice, all of which grow precisely as before, Boragine&aelig;,
Composit&aelig;, Labiat&aelig;, and Papilionace&aelig;, are the predominant
forms, and mostly of the same type: I observe a tendency among Boragine&aelig;
to have cup-shaped nuts.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the plants are the
same as those before found.&nbsp; Rheas, Papaver, Glaucium purpureum,
especially the two last are common, Labiata salvoides, Iris persica,
and crocifolia (rare), Trichonema, Gentiana, Alyssoides.</p>
<p>The novelties were Rheum, Silena fruticosa, Linaria, Ruta, Astragalina,
2 small Silenace&aelig;, Iris, Glaucium aureo-croceum, a beautiful Boragine&aelig;
with cup-shaped nut, Lotoides, an Hippophaoid looking shrub, Scrophularia
sp. singulous, Malthioloids spiralis, Allium, Glaux, Nitella, etc.&nbsp;
(See Catalogue 482 to 516.)&nbsp; Graminea very common, Rottboellia
and Anthistiria, 2 curious forms, the other more northern, Umbellifer&aelig;
common, Nari much less so than on the south face.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the summit which is nearly 7,000 feet, and of peaks
which rise 600 to 700 feet above the pass, has no change, except the
abundance of Crucifer&aelig; and Muscoides; Cerasus is the chief shrub;
Thymel&aelig;us frutex occurs at 6,500 feet.&nbsp; The prevailing rock
is clay slate.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;Marched to Dund-i-Golai, distance fifteen miles,
we first descended gradually to the plain, and then traversed this until
we skirted some low hills, about one and a half mile, from which a pool
of water was situated, where we halted, and which was fed by a small
cut coming from some distance.&nbsp; The road was very good throughout,
the water-cuts although not unfrequent, being either shallow or skirting
the left of the road.&nbsp; The vegetation continued the same as about
Chokey, until the plains were reached, but the prickly shrub, habitu
Berberidioides, became more common in the water-cuts below than I had
seen it before, while Santonia, Centaurea spinosa, and the plants of
Chokey, disappeared as we reached the plain, except some few herbaceous
forms, which continued throughout.&nbsp; I was much indisposed during
this march, and for the time we halted at Dund-i-Golai, a period of
four days, was unable to go out, but Capt. Sanders and my people brought
me many novelties, which I have not yet noted down.&nbsp; The chief
vegetation of the plain is Salsola tertia, the surface is level and
firm, clothed with scattered Salsola and a few stunted herbaceous plants,
among which a yellow Centaureoid, a Crucifera siliquis junioribus clavati
4-gonis, were the most common, there was also a curious Thiscoid looking
plant.&nbsp; A considerable change commenced about the low hills, a
Thymel&aelig;us shrub, some curious grasses, an Erodium, a Santonica,
occupying the places of the former shrubs, and Dipsacus or Scabiosa
becoming very common.&nbsp; The height of this place is about 4,040
feet, the climate most variable.&nbsp; Fahr. thermometer 48&deg; to
105&deg; in single roofed tents.&nbsp; No cultivation seen, a pool of
water is situated near the hill, and a little is reported as situated
half-way between this place and Chokey, this however I did not see.&nbsp;
The country is much parched up, and bears every appearance of always
having been so; no remains of tanks, villages, etc. visible.&nbsp; Painted
partridges were seen; and the eggs of a large bird like a plover?&nbsp;
The wind inclining to be hot, but it is cool up to 7&frac12; or 8 A.M.</p>
<p>Alaudo cristata? and an Alauda with the form of Sylvia.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>21st</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Killa Pootoollah,
a distance of ten miles.&nbsp; The road was good over an open, dry,
level country, but intersected with small cuts: some cultivation was
passed, but no villages.&nbsp; Some little improvement was observed
close to the Garrah hills, which are of the usual description, and of
no great height: a curious slip of the strata exhibited itself, in which
the upper strata are cut away in the centre as if there had been a watercourse
there.&nbsp; Vegetation continues the same.&nbsp; The Thymel&aelig;ous
shrub and Iris, still occur in sandy spots, Allium and a second species;
Centaureoides, yellow and pink, Thesioides, a curious sand-binding grass,
Salsola tertia most common, and in some open firm places <i>Joussa</i>
reappears as it did at Dund-i-Golai: Anthemis occurs, Rheas, Salvioides
in stony places, otherwise few of the plants of the Pisheen side are
seen; grapes abundant about old and new cultivation, Hordeum, Bromus
several species, Triticoides, etc., in profusion.&nbsp; Passed a deep
well of considerable diameter, which had an open communication with
a widish and deep canal, the only place I have seen that would hold
a good deal of water; it was cut throughout in shingle, and was perhaps
fifty feet in its deepest part.</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Left Pootoollah for Mailmandah, and on our arrival
found some of the troops and the cavalry had passed through and made
a double march to the river Lora, a distance in all of twenty-four miles.&nbsp;
There is a good deal of pure water at Mailmandah running in a cut by
the side of that, which is in the rains a considerable stream, also
one or two <i>Kabreezes</i> about two miles further on, producing excellent
water.&nbsp; The road first led up a ravine of some width, and swardy,
and then over low hills, until we surmounted these to descend into the
valley in which part of the army halted.&nbsp; The country continues
mostly the same; although if possible it is still more barren than before:
the mountains generally are more rugged: the ridges frequently toothed,
and the sides precipitous; not a tree to be seen except a willow near
some water, and a small arbusculoid fig.&nbsp; After passing the halting
place we re-ascended an inclined plane, entered a gorge, and again issued
out of it: after a short time again we entered into another valley drained
by an actual river, <i>really</i> <i>containing</i> <i>water</i>, and
bounded to the west and north-west by curious red low hills, not unlike
an embankment.&nbsp; The vegetation continues much the same: Salsola
tertia very common in some sandy places, Centaurea spinosa, Statice,
Santonia, etc. re-assuming their places on all gravelly slopes: some
novelties occurred as (See Catalogue, Nos. 543 to 574 inclusive,) one
or two new shrubs, Cytisus, etc.&nbsp; The heat continues great; 102&deg;
Fahr. in tents in the middle of the day.&nbsp; We encamped on a flat
ground about 200 yards from the river, which contains a good deal of
water, and has a sluggish stream running to the north, surrounded by
mountains, none of any height.&nbsp; Wheat cultivation, Arundo, Vitex,
Prunus or Cerasus abundant in the pass to the river, and yet the former
does not indicate water as it ought to do, Lycium, Tamarisk, Arundo
on the banks of the river, and Tamarisk in profusion in its bed.</p>
<p>The cultivation on the opposite side of the river is remarkably clear
of weeds, as compared with the cultivation at Quettah, etc.&nbsp; Achilleoides,
Veronica, Iris crocifolia, Phalaris, Chenopodium, Rottboellioides, Hordeum
vulgare, being the only or the chief plants cultivated.</p>
<p>Proceeded next to Dai Hap, thirteen miles, over a similar but even
more barren country, the hills being destitute of all vegetation, except
a few stunted small shrubs, such as Statice.&nbsp; The usual plants
recur with shingle and in sand, the chief is a <i>Santonica</i>, <a name="citation349"></a><a href="#footnote349">{349}</a>
a few novelties occurred, among which is a curious plant, with large
vesiculate petaloid connectiva.&nbsp; See Catalogue, No. 576, et sequent.</p>
<p>The hills continue with toothed ridges, near Dai Hap, where water
is abundant, but not in the form of a river.&nbsp; Thymel&aelig;a occurs
in abundance, with a Mimosea fruticosa humilis: a curious hairy-fruited
Polygonum et Peganum, is among the most common plants.</p>
<p><i>25th</i>.&mdash;To Khoshab, distance twelve miles, over a large
level plain, either sandy, and then generally cultivated, or gravelly,
and then uncultivated: road open: passed two dry beds of rivers: one
must be of large size, but is very shallow.&nbsp; A new Tamarisk occurs
along it; no trees are visible until we approach Candahar: vegetation
continues much the same.&nbsp; <i>Santonica</i>, (see above) Centaurea
spinosa, Astragalina (Ononoides recurs), Staticoid, Asphodelus, Mesembryanthoid,
Peganum, are the chief plants, especially on gravel; most of the small
Crucifer&aelig; have disappeared, Labiata-Salvioides continues; a curious
subaphyllous Composita occurs, Iris persica is not uncommon; another
Iris is found here and there in profusion, with Gnidia in sandy spots,
Composit&aelig;, Monocotyledons of Abigoon are common in shingle.&nbsp;
New rock pigeons.&nbsp; Fine madder cultivation in <i>khets</i>.&nbsp;
Of birds the yellow hammer occurs.&nbsp; Villages numerous, poor, and
though built of mud and straw yet present abundance of small domes.</p>
<p>In these dry hot plains the prevailing wind is westerly, blowing
very strong in the heat of the day, and having a tendency to become
hot: the thermometer is here 98&deg;.&nbsp; The cultivation of wheat
is very general around our present encampment which is within four miles
of Candahar, the wheat is fine; Lolioides occurs in it.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;Halted: Candahar is hid from us by some low hills,
on the surmounting of which a large straggling place is obscurely visible,
interspersed with trees, the valley is much smaller than that in which
we are now, which is very extensive.&nbsp; Munjit cultivation is conducted
by deep trenches, it is a different species I think from that of the
Himalayas.&nbsp; The bed of the Turnuk is now dry and very shallow:
and the hills near us are extremely barren, the chief vegetation being
P&aelig;derioides vestila and Staticoides cymosa, Cheiranthus continues.&nbsp;
The vegetation is very poor as indeed it has been since leaving the
Khojeb Amrah, nor is there any appearance to be seen of a better autumnal
vegetation.</p>
<p>Candahar is visible at a distance of six miles, from some low hills
to the north of our camp.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;Moved to Candahar, skirting the low hills just
mentioned and passed through two villages, a mile from Candahar in a
fine open plain.</p>
<p>Candahar has rather a pleasing aspect; it is situated close to a
picturesque range of hills, and is well diversified with trees, barley
and wheat fields.&nbsp; The slope on which the town stands is a parallelogram;
towers occur frequently along the wall, which is however, of mud, and
not strong; it is surrounded by a ditch utterly insignificant on account
of its narrowness and shelving banks, this ditch is crossed by an insignificant
causeway.&nbsp; The gate at which I entered is oblique, and is defended
by a tower: it leads into the main street which is rather wide and not
very dirty: towards the centre of this you pass under a middling dome,
a street branching off to the right and left; the continuation of the
main street or bazar leads to the <i>topekhanah</i>, or artillery ground,
a small space quite disorderly, containing eight or ten guns, most of
them melted at the mouth; one Sheik 18-pounder of cast iron, another
of English make, 140 years old.&nbsp; From the end of this space you
pass over another similar ditch into the fort, the entrance to which
is covered, affording two or three angles capable of good hand to hand
defence.&nbsp; Passing thence through some spaces occupied by low buildings,
you reach Khoondil Khan&rsquo;s house, an extremely rude looking place
outside, but very different within.&nbsp; It consists of two houses,
one looking into a small square with a delicious reservoir of water,
and some fine and very green mulberry trees; the ground being laid out
as a garden with sweet-william, etc.; the water is supplied by a small
cut, and is seven or eight feet deep.&nbsp; The garden fronts of both
houses are prettily ornamented, one has a <i>tharkhanah</i>, delightfully
cool; generally the rooms are small, coated with a pretty sort of stucco.&nbsp;
The remaining sides of the square are occupied by offices; small rooms
opening into the garden by lattice work evidently denote a portion of
the <i>zenana</i>.&nbsp; Altogether the Khan must be a man of taste.</p>
<p>The bazars of the city are well thronged, but the shops are by no
means equal to those of Buhawulpoor, and the manufactures, except those
of earthenware, are utterly insignificant.</p>
<p>Tobacco, <i>atta</i>, <i>musallahs</i>, dried fruits, <i>aloo</i>-<i>bokhara</i>,
figs, apricots, raisins, salt, sugar, a green fruit something between
a plum and greengage, meat, onions, salads, <i>dhie</i>, <i>sherbets</i>,
<i>kubabs</i>, wicker-work, singing birds, are offered for sale: also
abundance of Lucerne and some <i>bhoosee</i>.&nbsp; Altogether it is
a busy place, but not so busy as the road near the gate, which is thronged
by followers, and dismounted Europeans, who are forbidden access to
the city without a pass.&nbsp; Tea from Khiva of good quality is procurable
in small quantities.&nbsp; No women but old ones to be seen.&nbsp; The
dress of the inhabitants very often, and in some cases very completely,
approximates to that of the Chinese.&nbsp; The features too of most
are evidently of Tartar cast, and some wear two tails of plaited hair.&nbsp;
Blue seems to be a favourite colour of dress.</p>
<p>The chief trees about the city are mulberry, a few <i>Khunjucks</i>,
which is the Xanthoxylon of Bootan and the Kojhlak passes, occur outside;
willows are frequent, and generally appear to be cultivated, among these
a weeping species here and there occurs.</p>
<p><i>May</i> <i>3rd</i>.&mdash;The resources of the city are evidently
small, the only things indeed that appear plentiful are earthenware
and milk: grain is excessively dear, but is reported to exist in considerable
quantities.&nbsp; Khoondil Khan having ordered all those out of the
city, who had not provided themselves with six months&rsquo; provisions.&nbsp;
<i>Atta</i> or flour is now selling at two seers a rupee, or 6d per
pound, and every thing is proportionally dear: wood excessively so,
the chief fuel is derived from the <i>Santonia</i>, which in some form
or other appears to constitute a principal feature of the vegetation
of Central Asia, and there is some other wood apparently derived from
some tree I have not yet seen.</p>
<p>Some discontent prevails in the town owing to the high price of provisions,
which is, no doubt, severely felt.&nbsp; The established price of grain
is at the rate of eight seers the rupee, a rate established by the king,
but on occasions like the present there can be no rule.&nbsp; Water
is very abundant, it is to be found within four feet of the surface,
and some regiments have already supplied themselves from this source
by means of temporary wells.&nbsp; The water is excellent.</p>
<p>Asses, ponies, and horses are common, the former are excellent, 150
rupees is a good price for one; they carry heavy loads with the additional
weight of an Affghan on their back; the ponies or tattoes are less valuable,
but still they are strong.</p>
<p>The horses are indifferent; good, generally speaking, but heavy,
and with little spirit.&nbsp; Excellent milch cows have been procured
for twenty-five rupees, including the calf.&nbsp; Goats are not easily
procurable.&nbsp; Sheep (<i>Doombas</i>) are common, and afford excellent
mutton, they vary in price from two to three rupees.</p>
<p>Tea from Bokhara is procurable in small quantities; its quality is
decent: it was originally eight rupees a seer but is now thirty.&nbsp;
Coarse Russian cloths, and very inferior silks are also procurable.</p>
<p>The great drawbacks are the want of wood, and above all want of inhabitants;
from what I have seen of the cultivation, the soil appears to be very
capable, and well adapted to barley and wheat; rice might also be raised
as a summer crop.&nbsp; With regard to water, if there is a scarcity
of this element, it is due to the indolence of the people.&nbsp; I have
not yet seen any vestiges of buildings, topes, etc. to indicate that
Candahar has ever been a very populous place, the want of trees considering
the ease with which they may be cultivated, is a strong evidence of
the extreme laziness of the Affghans, who appear to me remarkably low
in the scale of civilization; and in personal habits, very generally
inexpressibly filthy.</p>
<p>Poplars, mulberries, and willows are the principal trees: the poplar
is very much akin to the <i>Sofaida</i> of the Sutledge, it is a handsome
tree, with a fine roundish crown.&nbsp; The fruit trees generally appear
small in gardens; lettuces and onions are commonly cultivated, especially
the latter, fields of Lucerne are very abundant, and I believe clover
also; a pony load of the former now costs five annas, but it is sufficient
for a day&rsquo;s consumption of two or three horses.&nbsp; The pomegranate
attains the ordinary size.&nbsp; In gardens two or three Ranunculace&aelig;,
Jasminum, pinks, sweet-williams, marigolds, stocks, and wall-flowers,
are common, with a broad-leaved species of flag, the flowers of which
I have not seen.</p>
<p>The crops vary according to the mode in which they have been watered;
if this has been properly done, they are rich.&nbsp; Some of the fields
are tolerably clean, others filled with weeds, among which a Dipsacea,
and one or two Centaure&aelig; are very common.</p>
<p>The villages are not generally defended: each house has its own straggling
direction, is built of mud, and the roof is generally dome-shaped, and
it has its own enclosure within a mud-wall.&nbsp; The houses are very
low, and indicate poverty, and want of ingenuity.&nbsp; The better order
appear always with arched roofs, and none are without picturesque ribs
and recesses.</p>
<p>The vineries here are so well enclosed, that there is no way of access
except by scaling the mud-wall: the vines are planted in trenches; a
row on each side, and allowed to run over the elevated spaces between
the trenches.&nbsp; In one garden pomegranates, a pomaceous tree, and
mulberries, whose fruit is now ripe but quite devoid of flavour, occurred.&nbsp;
A Zygophyllum, a beautiful Capparis, an Anthemis, Marrubium, Centaureoides
2, occurred as weeds, with Plantago, Phalaris, Cichorium.</p>
<p>For an excellent register of the thermometer at this place, I am
indebted to the kindness of Dr. Henderson; the range in the open air
is from 60&deg; to 110&deg;!!!</p>
<p>The variations in the wet bulb are due to the currents of air, which
beginning about 11 A.M., pass into a rather constant strongish west
wind about 11&frac12; or 2 P.M., and even almost become hot.&nbsp; The
climate is excessively dry, as indicated by the effects it has on furniture,
etc.</p>
<p>The difference of temperature between a tent, even with two flies
or double roof, and the open air in free situations, is by no means
great; thus when the thermometer was 105&deg; in part of my tent, it
was scarcely 110&deg; in the sun; in Capt. Thomson&rsquo;s large tent
102&deg;; placed against the outer <i>kunnat</i>, it rose to 105&deg;.&nbsp;
Hanging free with black cloth round the bulb, 112&deg;.&nbsp; But to
shew the great heating powers of the sun, the thermometer with the bulb,
placed on the ground and covered with the loose sand of the surface
of the soil, rose to 141&deg;.</p>
<p>Black partridges occur in the cornfields here, but in no great numbers.&nbsp;
Much of the cultivation of barley, wheat, and rye, is very luxuriant,
but the proportion of waste, to cultivated land is too considerable
to argue either a large population or active agricultural habits.&nbsp;
Pastor roseus occurs in flocks; it is evidently nearly allied to the
<i>mina</i>.&nbsp; The capabilities of this valley are considerable,
more particularly when the extreme readiness with which water is obtained
in wells is considered, as well as the nature of the soil, which is
well adapted to husbandry.&nbsp; Candahar, viewed from about a mile
to the west of our camp, backed by the picturesque hills (one bluff
one in particular), the numbers and verdure of the trees, the break
in the mountains on the Herat road, presents a pretty scene.</p>
<p><i>8th</i>.&mdash;The installation of the Shah, which took place
to-day on the plain to the north of the city, was a spectacle worth
seeing on account of the grand display of troops; but there were very
few of the inhabitants of Candahar or surrounding villages present.&nbsp;
Mulberries and apricots are now ripening.&nbsp; Rats, a Viverra with
a long body and short legs, tawny with brown patches, face broad, blackish-brown,
white band across the forehead, and white margins to the ears which
are large; storks were seen when alarmed.&nbsp; Pastor roseus occurs
in flocks; magpies, swallows, swifts, and starlings.&nbsp; There is
a garden with some religious buildings, to which an avenue of young
trees leads in a north-east direction from one of the Cabul gates, for
there are two on this face.&nbsp; The buildings are not remarkable;
nor are the trees, which are small; a few planes (Platanus) occur, the
most common is the <i>Benowsh</i>, a species of ash, (Fraxinus) of no
great size or beauty.&nbsp; The elegant palmate leaved Pomacea likewise
occurs, with the mulberry: the marigold is a great favourite.</p>
<p>The fields are now ripening, this being the harvest-moon.&nbsp; Wild
oats occur commonly, although they are not made any use of; the seed
is large, and ripens sooner than any of the others; from the size of
the uncultivated specimens, I am sure that oats would form an excellent
crop.</p>
<p>In the fields Cichorium is very common, and Carduacea, Centaurea
cyanea, Dipsace&aelig;, and in certain low places an Arundo, are the
most common weeds; two or three Silenace&aelig;, and Umbellifer&aelig;
also occur.&nbsp; In the ditches Typha, Butomus, watercresses, Alomioides,
Ceratophyllum, Lemna <i>gibba</i>? Conferv&aelig;, Gramine&aelig; two
or three, Ranunculus, Potamogeton, one species immersa; Mentha, Sium.</p>
<p>On the <i>Chummuns</i>, which are of no extent, but which are pleasing
from their verdure and soft sward chiefly consisting of Carex, Trifolium,
Juncus rigidus, Santalacea, and Gentiana likewise prevail.</p>
<p>The fields of Lucerne are luxuriant, but require much water, the
price of which is very dear; one ass-load costs eight annas!!</p>
<p>Iris crocifolia is common in old cultivations.</p>
<p>The city is situated at the termination of one of the shingly slopes,
which are universal between the bases of the hills, and the cultivated
portion of the valley.&nbsp; The ditch is hence shingly, whereas an
equal depth in the cultivated parts would meet nothing but a sandy,
light, easily pulverizable brownish-yellow soil, tenacious, and very
slippery when wet.&nbsp; The tobacco crop is excellent.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>
<p><i>Candahar</i> <i>to</i> <i>Cabul</i>.</p>
<p>The good old <i>Moolla</i> of a mosque, to which we resort daily,
gives me the following information about the vegetable products of this
country, from which it would seem, that every thing not producing food,
is looked upon with contempt.&nbsp; The fruit trees, are&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>Sha</i>-<i>aloo</i>, <i>Aloo</i>-<i>bookhara</i>, (damson),
which has ripe fruit in August, the same time as figs; <i>Zurd</i>-<i>aloo</i>,
(apricot), <i>Aloocha</i>&mdash;apricot, <i>Shuft</i>-<i>aloo</i>, another
kind of apricot; <i>Unar</i>, (pomegranate); <i>Ungoor</i>, (grapes);
<i>Unjeer</i>, (guava); <i>Bihee</i>, (figs); <i>Umroot</i>, <i>Toot</i>,
(mulberry); <i>Aloogoordaigoo</i>, <i>Shuft</i>-<i>aloo</i>, all these
<i>Aloos</i> being Pomaceous.</p>
<p>The El&aelig;agnus is called Sinjit: it produces a small red fruit,
used in medicine as an astringent, it ripens in August, and sells at
eight or nine seers the rupee; it is exported in small quantities; but
the plant is not much esteemed.</p>
<p>The <i>Munjit</i> is an article of much consequence; it is exported
chiefly to China and Bombay, some goes to Persia; the roots are occasionally
dug up after two years, but the better practise is to allow them five
to seven: the price is six Hindostanee maunds for a rupee.&nbsp; The
herb is used for camel fodder.&nbsp; The Affghan name is <i>Dlwurrung</i>.</p>
<p>The common Artemisia of this place is called <i>Turk</i>; the camels
are not so fond of it, as they were of the Sinab and Quettah sort; perhaps
this is due to their preferring Joussa, which is found in abundance.</p>
<p>The carrot is called <i>Zurduk</i>; it is dug in the cold months,
and sown in July; three seers are sold for a pice: both men and cattle
use it.</p>
<p><i>Turbooj</i>, (watermelon,) ripens in June; it is not watered after
springing up; four seers are sold for a pice.&nbsp; But I have not seen
much of this fruit.</p>
<p>The wheat is watered according to the quality of the soil, the better
the soil the less water is required, and this varies from four to eight
repetitions of water.&nbsp; <i>Jhow</i> requires two waterings less.&nbsp;
Wheat is considered dear if less than one maund is sold for the rupee.&nbsp;
One year ago, three maunds of barley, and four of wheat were sold for
a rupee.</p>
<p>Iris odora, <i>Soosumbur</i>; (the two kinds, and <i>Datura</i> has
the same name) is indigenous.</p>
<p>The timber trees, or rather trees not producing fruit, and which
the <i>Moolla</i> thinks very lightly of, are the <i>Chenar</i>, (plane),
<i>Pudda</i>, (Poplar?), Baid, <i>Sofaida</i>.</p>
<p>The fig trees are often planted in rows, they are very umbrageous,
and look very healthy.&nbsp; These, and the mulberry, are the most common;
next are the bullace and damson.&nbsp; Neither are worth introducing
to India, nor have I seen any thing yet in the country that is so.</p>
<p>It is certainly the interest of the inhabitants to keep the army
here as long as our commissariat places so many rupees in their hands.&nbsp;
It may indeed be questionable whether with an overpowering army, the
rates paid for grain and other supplies for the troops should not be
established by authority rather than advancing money for grain at exorbitant
rates, when the crops are entirely within the command of foraging parties.&nbsp;
<i>Atta</i> now sells at two and three-quarter seers the rupee, a mere
nominal fall, for the dealers will only give fifteen annas for a Company&rsquo;s
rupee.</p>
<p>There is a curious <i>hazy</i> appearance of the atmosphere over
the city in the evening, occasioned by fine dusty particles from cattle,
suspended in air; which, from their fineness, are long in subsiding.</p>
<p>This curious hazy weather increases daily, yesterday evening was
very cloudy, and this morning the wind rather strong and southerly up
to 8 A.M.: and at 5&frac12; P.M. the sun is either quite obscured, or
the light so diminished, that the eye rests without inconvenience on
his image.&nbsp; In the morning the wind strengthens as the sun attains
height and power.</p>
<p>The old <i>Moolla</i> says that this weather commences in Khorassan
with the setting in of the periodical rains in the north-western provinces
of India, and continues with them.&nbsp; From the direction of the wind
it is probably connected with the commencement of the south-west monsoon
at Bombay, for the rains at Delhi do not commence before June.</p>
<p>The haze is so strong at times that hills within three to five miles
are quite obscured; it tends to diminish the temperature considerably,
especially between seven and eight of a morning; curious gusts of hot
winds are observed, even when the general nature of the wind is cool.</p>
<p><i>21st</i>.&mdash;A fine and clear cold morning; thermometer 56&deg;
at 7 A.M. in the tent.&nbsp; Air fresh; thermometer 75&deg; at 9 P.M.&nbsp;
A few drops of rain at 12; <i>cloudy</i> <i>generally</i>.</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Thermometer 48&deg; at 5 A.M.&nbsp; Similar weather,
clear and elastic: south winds continue but of less strength.</p>
<p>Easterly wind prevails in the morning up to 9 A.M., after which hour
the westerly hot wind, variable in strength, sets in: the range of the
thermometer is then somewhat increased, although in the house it does
not rise above 90&deg;.</p>
<p>The <i>Moolla</i> tells me, that snow is of rare occurrence at Candahar;
he mentions one fall in about four or five years.&nbsp; The rains last
for three months, and happen in winter.&nbsp; During the winter all
occupations out of doors are suspended, and people wrap themselves up,
and sit over fires.</p>
<p>Clouds are of very rare occurrence, and then only partial.</p>
<p>The clouds, if resulting from the south-west monsoon, ought to be
intercepted by the Paropamisus and Hindoo Koosh, and rain ought to fall
along these and about Ghuznee at this time.&nbsp; In the evening a cool
wind sets in, indicating a fall of rain somewhere.</p>
<p>Rarity of dews in Khorassan: as dews depend on a certain amount of
moisture either in the soil or atmosphere, it follows that in a very
dry climate no dews will occur.&nbsp; The occurrence of the dews here
at this period, is another proof that rain must have fallen somewhere
(to the southward), to which the coolness of the weather is attributable.&nbsp;
Yesterday and to-day, the thermometer at 5 A.M. stood at 48&deg;, 49&deg;;
at 8 P.M. 75&deg;, 72&deg;, the daily range in the mosque is from 70&deg;
to 80&deg;.&nbsp; Capt. Thomson suggests that the dews observed here
are either confined to, or much greater in the <i>Chummuns</i>, in which
the water is very close to the surface, as indicated <i>inter</i> <i>alia</i>
by the green turf.</p>
<p>The kinds of grapes are numerous; those earliest ripe are the black,
and a small red kind called <i>Roucha</i>; which will be ripe in the
latter end of this moon.&nbsp; <i>Kismiss</i> another sort, comes in
July.&nbsp; The <i>Tahibee</i> is the best kind produced here, and the
dearest.</p>
<p>Tobacco is cultivated chiefly along the Arghandab; it is planted
about this season, and gathered in two or three months, and requires
to be watered ten or twelve times.</p>
<p>The barley is now fully ripe, and is generally cut and thrashed in
some places.&nbsp; Pears in gardens are now ripe.</p>
<p>Candahar valley is of great extent to the westward, or south-west
and SSW.</p>
<p>The wasps, with large femora, I observe build their mud nests in
houses.&nbsp; The rarity of Lepidoptera, except perhaps some nocturnal
moths, is curious; Coleoptera are more common, but inconspicuous.&nbsp;
Ants are abundant in the mud walls.&nbsp; A small gnat with large noiseless
wings, is very annoying, and the bite very painful and irritating.&nbsp;
Doves, and wild pigeons are tolerably common, as also crested larks,
and swifts.&nbsp; Abundance of lizards; a venomous snake of brown colour,
having an abruptly attenuated tail.</p>
<p>Every thing that happens shows how credulous, and how unenquiring
we are; and in all cases out of our particular sphere, how extremely
apt most are to give excessive credit, where a moderate only is due.&nbsp;
It is a generous failing which it is difficult to condemn, particularly
with regard to our travellers in this direction.&nbsp; Instance Connolly,
and certainly Gerard whose acquaintance with Burnes and its results
demands attention.&nbsp; It is singular that his name scarcely occurs
in Burnes&rsquo; book, although his scientific knowledge and MSS. submitted
to Government, entitle him to be considered an observant, and well-informed
traveller.&nbsp; Pottinger is another instance of what I have said above.</p>
<p>The general opinion is, and it is one which I have not discarded
entirely, that he threw himself into Herat, that he was throughout the
siege daily employed in the front of the garrison, and that it is owing
to his personal exertions that Herat was saved.&nbsp; I hear however
on good authority that he was at Herat accidentally, and wished to leave
it when the besiegers appeared, but was prevented by want of funds.&nbsp;
So anxious was he however to get away, as his leave of absence had expired,
that he was obliged to discover himself to Yar Mahommed, and request
loans to enable him to rejoin India.&nbsp; The Vizier at once secured
him, took him to Kamran, and hindered him from leaving, forcing him
indeed to the dangerous elevation of British Agent at Herat.&nbsp; His
merits, if this be true, rest on very different grounds from those generally
supposed; his courage however has been proved of a high moral cast.</p>
<p>The <i>Joussa</i>, the <i>Moolla</i> tells me, is the <i>Kan</i>
<i>Shootur</i> or <i>Shootur</i> <i>Kan</i>.&nbsp; Burnes&rsquo; account
of the <i>Turunjbeen</i> or manna is correct, except perhaps in the
limits he assigns to its production.&nbsp; It is at any rate produced
here and sold in the bazar, its production while the plant is in flower
is curious, and worthy of examination; it may however be deposited by
an insect, in which case the probable period of its production would
be that of inflorescence.</p>
<p>There is some cultivation of Indian corn here, the plants have now
attained one-third of their growth.</p>
<p>Except in the immediate vicinity of the town, nothing can exceed
the sterility of the valley, or rather its desolation: scarcely a plant,
beyond the Peganum and <i>Joussa</i>, is to be found.</p>
<p><i>Khaisee</i>, an excellent smooth skinned apricot, is now ripe,
and is of light yellowish colour, sometimes faintly spotted; it is a
product from grafts, the seeds are useless, as they do not continue
the good qualities of the fruit: it is here grafted on <i>zurd</i>-<i>aloo</i>,
<i>thulk</i>, Potentilla quinquefolia.</p>
<p>Melons and grapes are now coming in; the former, at least those I
have seen, have pale pulp, and are not superior.&nbsp; The grapes first
ripe are the ordinary black sort: we tasted yesterday some very good
ones in the <i>Moolla&rsquo;s</i> garden.&nbsp; The <i>Kismiss</i> are
especially delicate, and another large sort of very fine rich flavour,
both were rather unripe.&nbsp; Those for packing are still unripe.&nbsp;
The trenches in this garden are very deep: the vines are planted on
the northern face only.</p>
<p>Gardens are very common to the south-west of the town.&nbsp; The
valley of the Arghandab is the most fertile part of Khorassan I have
yet seen.&nbsp; A strip of cultivation extends along the banks of the
river, and from these last not being high, the stream is easily diverted
into channels for irrigation.&nbsp; Seen from any of the neighbouring
hills, the valley presents one uniform belt of verdure, almost as far
as the eye can reach, and the view up and down is of some extent.&nbsp;
The chief cultivation is wheat, barley, and lucerne; <i>Chummuns</i>
also occur.&nbsp; Gardens abound, together with fine groves of mulberry
trees, the former are walled in, and are verdant to a degree.</p>
<p>There is a bluff mountain to the north of Candahar, the disintegration
of which is so rapid, that it is evident from the slope of the debris,
it will in time bury the original structures.</p>
<p>The hills forming the ridge separating Arghandab from Candahar, as
well as all those rugged looking ones about Candahar, are of limestone,
they are much worn by the weather, and full of holes.&nbsp; They are
very barren, the only shrubby vegetation of any size being Ficus, which
may be the stock of the <i>Ungoor</i>, as it resembles it a good deal,
Centaurea spinosa, P&aelig;deri&aelig; 2, Echinops, Pommereulla, one
to two, other Gramin&aelig;, lemon-grass, Dianthus, Peganum, Cheiranthus
as before, Sedum rosaceum, Gnaphalium, <i>Hyoceyamus</i>, <i>Didymocarpe&aelig;</i>,
Gnidia, etc.</p>
<p>The Arghandab is a good sized river, with channel subdivided: its
stream is rapid and fordable; no large boulders occur in its bed; the
temperature of its water is moderate.</p>
<p>The fish are a Cyprinus and a Barbus, or Oreinus with small scales,
thick leathery mouth, and cirrhi; a Loach of largish size, flat head,
reddish, with conspicuous brownish mottlings, and a Silurus.</p>
<p>The hills forming the northern boundary of the valley are picturesque,
and of several series, and perhaps the subordinate valleys are not so
large and fruitful in this direction.</p>
<p>Between Arghandab and Candahar, two ranges occur; one interrupted:
the other nearer Candahar has first to be surmounted at a low pass;
the pass is short, rugged and impassable for guns.&nbsp; The inner ridge
is much closer to the cultivated part of the valley than the northern
range.</p>
<p>Between it and the Arghandab, at least six cuts occur: these are
met with generally in threes, and are at different elevations; the inner
one being close at the foot of the hills; great labour must have been
required to make them.&nbsp; Numerous villages, some with flat roofed
houses occur.</p>
<p>Arundo, Salsola, Plantago, P. coronopoid, Cnicus, Juncus, Veronica
exallata, Santalacea, Mentha, Lactucoides, Chenopod. 2-3, Panicum, Samolus,
Ceratophyllum; Salix occurs near the river; apricots, apples, pomegranates,
damsons or plums, bullaces, pears, mulberries and raspberries in the
gardens.</p>
<p>The shingle found about all the hills in Khorassan, can scarcely
be derived from any source but disintegration, it slopes too gradually
and uniformly for upheavement.&nbsp; If my idea is correct, the mountains
will at some period be buried in their own debris, of course inspection
of the shingle will at once point out whether this is true or not, more
especially <i>in</i> <i>all</i> <i>those</i> <i>places</i> <i>where</i>
<i>the</i> <i>rocks</i> <i>are</i> <i>of</i> <i>uniform</i> <i>structure</i>.&nbsp;
There is a curious desert to the south and southwest of Candahar, elevated
a good deal above the valley, quite bare, and stretching a long way
to the westward: it is seen for forty miles along the Girishk road.</p>
<p><i>Curious</i> <i>reflection</i>.&mdash;Observed in ghee used as
lamp-oil, a bubble ascending from the surface of the water on which
it floated, met by another descending; the deception of this is perfect.&nbsp;
That it is due to reflection, is apparent from the variation of the
length of the descent, according to the angle under which it is viewed.&nbsp;
When viewed from beneath at a very oblique angle, the descent is complete,
but if viewed parallel to the surface, no appearance of the sort occurs.&nbsp;
The reflection is due to the surface of the ghee which appears to be
more dense than the rest, probably more oily; this mathematical reflection
may suggest others of a moral nature, touching our liability to mistaken
views of things, from observing only one side.</p>
<p>Old Candahar is about three miles to west of the new town; it is
immediately under a steep limestone range, running about southwest,
and not exceeding 500 feet in height.&nbsp; It bears marks of having
been fortified, and at either extremity remains of forts are still visible.&nbsp;
The fort of forty steps is at the north end of the range.&nbsp; The
town is in complete ruins; indeed none of the edifices are visible except
those that occupy the mound of stones, (with which they are partly built)
probably the site of the citadel.&nbsp; On three sides, the town is
fenced by two respectable ditches, the outer one about 50 yards wide;
both are now, especially the outer, beds of marshes; they were supplied
by cuts from the Arghandab river.&nbsp; Wells exist however.&nbsp; There
is one white mosque in good preservation.&nbsp; The works were strong,
and much better than the very indifferent ones of new Candahar; and
the walls of the town were prolonged up the face of the hills.</p>
<p>About Candahar, conical houses occur, probably for granaries.&nbsp;
A curious mosque cut out of the rock in situ, is seen on the Girishk
road, with a flight of steps leading to it, cut in like manner out of
the rock.&nbsp; There is also in the same quarter the fort of Chuhulzeenat,
or forty steps; a work not of very considerable extent; and as in other
Asiatic countries I have visited, troughs are cut in rocks for separating
grain from the husk.&nbsp; But there is no work to be seen indicating
vast labour or any genius.</p>
<p>Some remains of good pottery may be picked up; and the earth of which
the works, etc. were made, is filled with remains of coarse pottery.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;Moved four miles to Shorundab, the country is
very barren: not much <i>Joussa</i>: the water is brackish at our present
encampment, which is within sight of Babawallee.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Kileeyazim, ten and a quarter miles,
marched at 2 P.M. and reached the place at 6 P.M., the camels arriving
one hour afterwards: the ground is generally good, throughout stony,
difficult in places and undulated, particularly in two situations occasioned
from cuts.&nbsp; There is a square fort, situated at the halting place
with a tower at each corner, and on north face two; as well as towers
at the gate: but without windows.&nbsp; <i>Joussa</i> is abundant, as
also grass along the cuts.&nbsp; Salsola rotundifolia, a Chenopodia,
and a curious prickly, leafless Composita and <i>Joussa</i> occur, the
latter most common, Artemisi&aelig; sp.&nbsp; Also rock pigeons and
the raven.&nbsp; Halted one mile to the east of the fort.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to the Turnuk, near Khet-i-Ahkoond,
distance fifteen and a half miles.&nbsp; The country continues the same,
no cultivation to be seen before reaching the Turnuk.&nbsp; The road
tolerable, over gravelly or shingly ground: it was at first level, until
we reached a mountain gorge, when it became undulated.&nbsp; Passed
the dry beds of two streams, the second the larger: its banks were clothed
with Vitex instead of Tamarisk.&nbsp; At the entrance of gorge a fort
similar to that of yesterday was passed.&nbsp; Scarcely any change in
vegetation.&nbsp; Artemisi&aelig; one or two, Centaurea spinosa, Salsola
cordifolia and aphylla? are the most common plants, Euonymus and Malpighiacea?
Polygonoides, occurred along the nullah, a pretty species of the plant,
Antheris globosis petaloideo-terminalis, in profusion in some places,
literally colouring the ground: close to it another very distinct species,
foliis connatis, floribus albis, a Rubiaceous crystalline looking plant,
another novelty; all the plants about the hills at Candahar continue:
Dianthoid, Statice, P&aelig;deria villosa.&nbsp; Cultivation along the
Turnuk, melons in small trenches, the crops are now cut, <i>Jhow</i>
or <i>gaz</i> along the bank: but there is not much water.&nbsp; The
hills around are apparently of limestone, very picturesque, and presenting
very fine cliffs.&nbsp; The valley of the Turnuk is here very narrow,
and the country very arid looking, completely burnt up.&nbsp; <i>Joussa</i>
rather scarce, <i>doob</i> grass occurs along the river, the water of
which is discoloured.</p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Shair-i-Suffa, ten miles and six
furlongs.&nbsp; The country continues the same.&nbsp; The road extending
along the right bank of the Turnuk, over undulating ground for one and
a half or two miles, is bad, very narrow, and overhanging the steep
bank of the river, scarcely passable for wheel carriages without preparation.&nbsp;
Vegetation continues precisely the same: little verdure to be seen even
along the Turnuk: the hills desperately barren; a high mound occurs
in middle of the valley near our halting place, well adapted for a fort,
but unoccupied.&nbsp; Small fields of cultivation are now seen.&nbsp;
A small species of mullet occurs in the river: thermometer 101&deg;
at 1 P.M. in the tent.</p>
<p>Nothing can exceed the barren aspect of this valley, which is near
Khet-i-Ahkoond, but at several miles distance, a few trees are visible
in nooks: the only green along the banks of the river, is occasioned
apparently by Tamarisk: the hills are picturesque, rugged, varied with
bold cliffs, the valleys are changed in structure, being now occupied
by rounded undulated ground, instead of hollow basins.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m363.jpg">
<img alt="River Turnuk banks" src="images/m363.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>July</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Proceeded ten miles, and halted on
the Turnuk within one mile of the tower of Tirandaz.&nbsp; The country
continues precisely the same: the road at first is bad, owing to the
inhabitants having tried to flood it.&nbsp; At a distance of six miles
we ascended a small defile without any difficulty; the remainder of
the march being over undulating stony ground: the valley then becomes
narrow, and we again enter into the arable part, which is especially
narrow.&nbsp; The hills present the same aspect.&nbsp; <i>Joussa</i>
very abundant, and also Artemisia, and a Salsoloides flore ochroleuco.&nbsp;
No villages are visible.&nbsp; We are unable to judge of the extent
of cultivation, because the country, which seems uniformly dried up,
is rugged and bouldery: on the right is the old bed of the river, consisting
of dry sand.&nbsp; We crossed one small nullah, when an old fort became
visible on a hill, in the centre of the valley.</p>
<p><i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Toot, a distance of eleven miles,
through a similar country; the road dividing at the low hills approaching
the river and forming its banks, which are in places precipitous; the
greater part of the difficulties were avoided by taking the lower route,
that along the hills being impassable for guns owing to the large rocks
scattered in every direction, and detached from conglomerate hills.&nbsp;
Two or three nullahs were passed, one with a little water.&nbsp; The
ground was besides a good deal cut up towards the centre of the valley,
and a water-cut was crossed several times.&nbsp; Owing to the delay
in making the road, the troops did not reach the encamping ground before
8 or 8&frac12; P.M., the camels in some instances not before 12 P.M.&nbsp;
An attack is reported to have been made on the baggage at the river
where the road ascends the cliff: it was prevented by a party of the
13th, who shot two of the marauders.&nbsp; <i>Joussa</i> is plentiful,
and Mentha in flower.</p>
<p>The Turnuk river is 20 feet broad, the current rapid, and the water
discoloured; the banks are sandy, 15 feet high: coarse grass, Clematis
scandens fol. ternatisectis pinnatis.&nbsp; <i>Jhow</i> is abundant.</p>
<p><i>3rd</i>.&mdash;From Toot to ----, nine miles and four furlongs.&nbsp;
Road decent, over the usual sort of ground, except in one place, where
the bank approaches the river; this defile is much shorter and much
easier than that at Tirandaz or rather Jillongeer: a small river with
a little water is crossed: here the road for a very short distance bends
suddenly to a little west of north, but having crossed a narrow and
deep ravine-like cut, resumes its original direction.&nbsp; The country
continues precisely the same, the valley however becomes narrow and
more undulating, while the peculiar limestone ranges appear to be fewer.&nbsp;
Reached the encamping ground in very good time, the vegetation almost
precisely the same as before, but with some willow trees.&nbsp; Many
of the ravines are however, actually covered with thickets, apparently
of the prickly yellow flowered Dioica shrub of <i>Chummun</i>; trees
and these shrubs occupied by thousands of a hymenopterous insect or
fly.&nbsp; <i>Joussa</i> very abundant: a village, the lights of one
were visible <i>en</i> <i>route</i>.&nbsp; The water of the Turnuk is
still very much discoloured, its bed shingly, and the ground near it
much cut up: a mill was passed on the river; the valley here not being
500 yards wide: the climate is more agreeable, though still very hot
in the middle of the day; in the shade, the air continues pleasant up
to 10 A.M.&nbsp; Thunder not heavy, was succeeded by a squall from the
ENE.; little rain fell, but there were clouds of dust.</p>
<p><i>4th</i>.&mdash;Reached Khilat-i-Gilzee, distance thirteen and
a half miles, from our last encampment, direction NE. by E. as before:
the aspect of the country is unchanged, the road became somewhat difficult
about one and a half mile from camp, where a defile exists along the
hills forming the bank of the river; it was however much easier than
that of Botee.&nbsp; Thence we continued over undulating ground, leaving
the Turnuk river to the right, but reverting to it beyond the fort.&nbsp;
Half-way the deep and steep channel of a river presented a serious obstacle;
the country gradually rises until Khilat-i-Gilzee fort is passed, from
thence it descends somewhat.&nbsp; At this place there is a considerable
expanse of irregular valleys; and to south curious low undulated ground
occurs: to the south-east is a patch of table land, which is not an
uncommon form in these parts; some cultivation here exists along the
Turnuk, which runs half a mile below the fort, which is in ruins, occupying
a hill not commanded by any near ones.&nbsp; This is of no great height,
and has two ramifications, and in the centre the remains of a tower.</p>
<p>In the valley extending NNE. two villages with castles occur, together
with a good many low trees.&nbsp; Vegetation the same: a curious Antirrhinoid
plant occurs out of flower, Echinops, Carduacea, and a curious Centaurea.&nbsp;
Wet places abound in Rumex and Tamarisk along the river.&nbsp; Horsemen
were seen after passing the fort: two or three willow trees about the
villages.&nbsp; <i>Jhow</i> or barley is selling for ten seers the rupee,
<i>atta</i> or flour at eight.</p>
<p><i>5th</i>.&mdash;Khilat-i-Gilzee is a very uninteresting place,
with little appearance of cultivation.&nbsp; The vegetation of the undulated
ground continues the same, Asphodelus, Mesembryanthemoides, remains
of Tauschia, and the former Crucifer&aelig;.&nbsp; The Turnuk discharges
a good deal of water much discoloured, and forming a series of constant
rapids.&nbsp; The most common plants are Artemisi&aelig; two or three
species, Centaurea spinosa, Salsola luteiflora, Almond groves, Iris
crocifolia? vel sp. affinis, Asphodelus, Mesemb., Salvioides, Thermopsis,
Cichorium, <i>Joussa</i>, and Mentha recur, the two last in abundance.&nbsp;
The new plants are a Chenopodium, Polygonum, Lotoides, Triticum, Astragalus,
Scirpus, C&aelig;salpinioides, Centaurea micrantha, and Eryngioides:
a spring occurs in the old fort of Khilat-i-Gilzee.</p>
<p>Indian-corn is just sprouting up, barley and other crops ripe.&nbsp;
Latitude of Khilat-i-Gilzee 32&deg; 7' 30&quot;; altitude, Bar. 24.740:
the climate is disagreeable from the violent sudden extremes to which
it is exposed.&nbsp; West winds during day, and east winds of a morning.</p>
<p><i>6th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Sir Tasp, ten miles, north-east, road
good over an open undulating country, the only difficulty in the way
arising from a cut with deep holes in it.&nbsp; Vegetation continues
precisely the same: limestone hills less frequent, or at any rate much
less rugged, and the country assumes a much more open character.&nbsp;
Artemisia most abundant, of large size, C&aelig;salpinia, Euonymus dioica,
Centaurea spinosa, Echinops, new plants two Linari&aelig;, Eryngium,
Verbascum.&nbsp; Altitude 24.505, latitude 32&deg; 12' 22&quot; north.&nbsp;
<i>Atta</i> has risen in price to seven seers a rupee.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;Arrived at Nooroock after a march of nine miles;
still extending up the valley in a direction north-east&mdash;direct
on the star Capella.&nbsp; The country is undulated; vegetation still
the same.&nbsp; Artemisia most abundant and of a larger size; road good:
no fodder for horses, except along the river: the valley open, distant
hills on either side with a fine range to the north of the camp, apparently
composed of limestone, with abundance of junipers, and the Iris of Dund-i-Golai
very common.&nbsp; Hares, rock pigeons, Alauda.&nbsp; Myriads of Cicada,
and the Jerboa rat.&nbsp; The Turnuk river is again occasionally in
sight, valley apparently little cultivated.&nbsp; Stipa very common,
as well as Iris, Festuca vivipara, Astragali sp., and Artemisia.&nbsp;
Cloudy evening, followed by a stormy night; wind southerly.</p>
<p><i>8th</i>.&mdash;Reached Tazee, eight miles seven furlongs from
Nooroock: direction still the same, no change: the road good, extending
over an undulated country, except one or two small nullahs with rather
steep banks.&nbsp; A range of mountains seen to the north, called Kohi-Soork,
continue forming a long line, the southern boundary of which is broken:
we are encamped opposite a valley running east, presenting much cultivation:
several villages indicated by distant <i>smoke</i>: some trees are seen
here and there: the face of the valley is rather green, indicating more
water than usual.&nbsp; Vegetation is precisely the same; no <i>Joussa</i>
or other fodder for camels than Artemisia and spinous Composit&aelig;.&nbsp;
Morning very cloudy and cold at 12 P.M.&nbsp; The plants met with are
Chara, Naiad, Polygoni 3, Malva fl. amplis lilacinis, on banks of river.</p>
<p><i>9th</i>.&mdash;<i>Shuftul</i>, five miles: the direction lay towards
the star Capella: road bad, requiring to be made over three difficult
ravines, all forming beds of torrents descending from the Koh-i-Soork.&nbsp;
The country otherwise presents the same features.&nbsp; The Turnuk runs
close under the southern boundary of the valley, and is here a pretty
stream of considerable body.&nbsp; <i>Joussa</i> grows abundantly on
its immediate banks, together with excellent grass and some clover,
one or two new Composit&aelig;, one of them a Matthiola, otherwise Artemisi&aelig;,
Stipa, Centaurea spinaceis herb.&nbsp; Astragalus, and Peganum, are
the most common; Muscoides, Plantaginacea reoccur, a curious <i>leaved</i>
Composita?</p>
<p><i>10th</i>.&mdash;Halted yesterday, and went out along the banks
of the Turnuk: where I found twenty-six species not obtained before.&nbsp;
Some cultivation was observed, but as usual weedy, abounding with two
species of Centaurea.&nbsp; In ditches two species of Epilobium, Sparganium,
Mentha, Polygonum natans, Ranunculus aquaticus, Lotus, Carex, Astragaloid
on swards, on the sandy moist banks of the Turnuk: Epilobium, two Veronic&aelig;,
several Cyperace&aelig;, 2 or 3 Junci, Cyperus fuscus.&nbsp; Alisma
abundant in swamps: small partridges: no chakor: hares, swifts, rock-pigeons.&nbsp;
Springs of beautiful clear water: temperature not changeable, 59&deg;;
two small platiceroid fishes in it; tadpoles.&nbsp; Temperature of the
river 78&deg;.&nbsp; The fish of this river are the same as those of
the Arghandab, the large Cyprinus takes Cicada greedily.&nbsp; The vegetation
of the hills is the same: Cerasus pygm&aelig;us and canus, common; the
novelties were a fine Composita, Plectranthus, Ephedra in fruit, Artemisia,
and Astragal., formed the chief bulk; <i>Joussa</i> is common on the
river sides.</p>
<p>This place is 150 feet above the last, yet the increased elevation
is not appreciable to the sight: the tents of the army at the Tazee
encampment are distinctly visible.&nbsp; <i>Atta</i> sold, at eight
seers yesterday, barley sixteen seers for the rupee.&nbsp; Where the
sellers come from I know not.&nbsp; <i>Atta</i> was fifteen seers, but
it was soon made eight by the approach of the army, and to-day it has
risen to four and a half.</p>
<p><i>11th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Chushm-i-Shadee, ten miles six furlongs,
direction the same: road good, not requiring any repairs; it continues
up the valley but at a greater distance from the river than before;
the valley is enclosed in hills on both sides.&nbsp; Koh-i-Soork, the
northern one, is not very high, but bold and cliffy, with very little
cultivation: the country is less undulated.&nbsp; Chushm-i-Shadee is
a beautiful spring, not deep, but extending some distance under ground;
large-sized fish are found in it: apparently Ophiocephali, but only
parts of their bodies can be seen.&nbsp; Indian-corn and madder are
cultivated: a new Asteraceous flower was found.&nbsp; Passed a small
eminence in the centre of the valley, about three miles from Chushm-i-Shadee.&nbsp;
<i>Joussa</i> very abundant.&nbsp; Temperature of spring 59&deg;.</p>
<p><i>12th</i>.&mdash;Reached Chushm-i-Pinjup, six and a half miles,
direction more northerly; keeping Capella a little to the right: the
country is precisely the same, the road good, one or two easy ravines;
one with water in it.</p>
<p>The valley is rather wider, soil much less shingly, and capable of
cultivation; several patches of trees are visible in many directions,
indicating villages.&nbsp; We encamped opposite the entrance or gap
between the mountains forming hitherto the southern boundary, and a
more lofty range is seen running parallel with them, about east and
west.&nbsp; This range is of considerable height; presenting a <i>peculiar</i>
<i>slope</i> rising almost half-way up, and very conspicuous: four forts
are seen in this direction; together with several patches of trees,
and a good deal of cultivation, but nothing to what might exist.&nbsp;
Artemisia is the chief shrub; several good springs occur: clover, and
good grass are both abundant for a small party; <i>Joussa</i> in cultivation.&nbsp;
The mountain range to the north is very fine, and apparently of different
formation from the others; here and there whitish patches occur.&nbsp;
There is a very evident slope, which is very gradual from the northern
range to the <i>peculiar</i> slope of the southern.</p>
<p>Several springs of fine water occur: the temperature of which is
60&deg;.&nbsp; Fish are abundant about the mouths of these springs,
which are like caves; their waters form one of the heads of the Turnuk,
along them Mentha, Gramine&aelig; 2, Plantago major, Centaurea magnispina,
Composit&aelig;, Trifolium.&nbsp; In the spring Polygonum natans, and
P. graminifol., Chara, Cyperac&aelig;.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>13th</i>.&mdash;Gojhan, the distance to this place is 12 miles
6 furlongs: it is not within sight of the Turnuk, though still up the
valley of that river, with the same boundaries: a few ravines were crossed
but they were not difficult: the road, otherwise level, turning most
of them, and capable of easy transit.&nbsp; One small stream was passed,
when we encamped on a small cut with excellent water: the banks as usual
clovery and grassy; opposite this are two villages on either side of
a gorge in the northern boundary, both apparently fortified; the one
to the north of the gorge is of large size.&nbsp; The country is not
shingly, but the soil is mixed with small pebbles; to our right is a
bold hill; vegetation the same.&nbsp; <i>Bicornigera</i> planta is very
common, and a good deal of madder cultivation occurs; wheat and barley
all cut and thrashed or trodden out: <i>atta</i> selling eight and a
half seers the rupee.&nbsp; Thermometer at day break 49&deg;, the west
winds continue strong: they arise about 11 A.M. and continue till sunset,
sometimes even a little later; they are not hot.</p>
<p>This place, and its environs, is one of the most promising looking
I have seen; the whole face of the country being perhaps capable of
cultivation.&nbsp; No <i>Joussa</i> seen except perhaps among the cultivated
fields; grass is plentiful enough for a small force, and <i>Boosee</i>
likewise.</p>
<p>Quails were seen on the march at some distance: it seems to be a
great country for potash, and perhaps for camphor, which is evidently
abundant in one species of Artemisia.</p>
<p><i>14th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Mookhloor or <i>Chushm</i>-<i>i</i>-<i>Turnuk</i>,
twelve and a half miles; direction about NNE.&nbsp; The country is the
same, but the road is more raviny: certain passes occur about three
miles from Gojhan, presenting a fine defile, and some smaller ones afterwards.&nbsp;
Vegetation continues the same.&nbsp; Artemisi&aelig;, Astragali, and
Peganum, are most common; observed a new Astragalus.&nbsp; The valley
is much wider after passing Gojhan; the southern boundary is not so
distinct, owing to the haze: there is not much cultivation, which appears
to be confined to the slopes under the hills.&nbsp; Mookhloor is situated
under a fine limestone cliff; and an excellent stream of water occurs
here, and abundance of fine grass along the humid banks: along this
water villages are abundant, they are all fortified.&nbsp; Trees are
plentiful, indeed after Candahar and Arghandab, this is the best looking
place we have seen: the view is not distinct however, owing to the haze
above alluded to: beyond the water, lies a vast and barren plain.&nbsp;
Fish are abundant in the stream, and vegetation luxuriant along its
margins.&nbsp; This stream divides into two or three branches, which
are all soon choked up with sedges, etc., a cut carries off the greater
part of the water, the slope is to the south, or a little to the west
of south.</p>
<p>Typha angustifolia occurs in profusion, Mentha, Cochlearia, Epilobi&aelig;
2, Calamus abundant, Cyperace&aelig; in profusion, Ranuncul. aquatic,
Alisma ditto.&nbsp; The vegetation of the plain where we are encamped
is chiefly Artemisia.</p>
<p><i>15th</i>.&mdash;Halted: and I here ascended the hills overhanging
the heads of Turnuk where many villages are visible along its branches,
fifty may be counted, but it is not known how many of these are in ruins,
the villages occur at little distances from each other; the valley is
very broad.&nbsp; These hills, which are of conglomerate limestone,
except about the upper one-third, which is simple limestone, have no
peculiar vegetation.&nbsp; Ficus is the only moderate sized shrub, Asphodelus,
Lameoides, Salvia alia, which must be a beautiful species, Labiat&aelig;
c&aelig;spitosa, B&aelig;hmerioides, Pommereulla, and several grasses,
Composit&aelig;, Linaria, Senecionoides glaucescens of Quettah, Dianthoides
frutex alius congener, Staticoides alia, Composita Eryngifolia, Eryngium,
Astragali 2, Umbellifer&aelig; 2-3, Hibiscus vel Alth&aelig;i, Rut&aelig;
sp.; Frutex pistacioides, Sedoides rosaceus, Onosma, Verbascum, Dipsacea,
Cerasus pygm&aelig;us, canus, Scrophularia tertia, Composit&aelig;,
Labiat&aelig;, and grasses, are all the most common plants.</p>
<p>The novelties along the water are a pretty species of Astragalus,
in turf a Triglochin and Typha in flower, Potamogetons 3-4, and Ecratophyllum
occur: barley is now selling at sixteen seers, wheat at eight seers
for a rupee.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;Reached Oba-kahreeze, the distance of which from
the last encampment being fourteen miles.&nbsp; The country is open,
but very uninteresting; the boundary hills are scarcely discernible
owing to haze: the road is good, and a few small hills occur here and
there.&nbsp; Vegetation is comparatively scanty; Astragalus novus, common;
the chief plants, however, is another Artemisia of much more medicated
qualities than those previously met with, that is, less fragrant, Peganum
common.&nbsp; Water is plentiful enough, but fodder is scarce, and scarcely
any <i>Joussa</i> occurs; but a good deal of cultivation was passed,
consisting of madder, barley, and wheat.&nbsp; A few trees were observed
here and there marking the sites of villages.&nbsp; The country is much
poorer than that at Mookhloor, but almost the whole expanse of plain
is capable of good cultivation: soil pebbly.&nbsp; Fowls a good many
are procurable.&nbsp; Apricots are also brought for sale, but very inferior:
a striking boundary hill to the north presents a rugged, lofty aspect,
not less in the peaks than 4,000 above the plain; several ranges occur,
but those to the south are low, rounded, and small; rounded clumps of
Astragali are seen.</p>
<p><i>17th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Jumrat, 12 miles and 2 furlongs,
our direction lying to the north of the star Capella.&nbsp; The country
continues to present a similar aspect: valley expanded, road tolerable,
several ravines and beds of dry watercourses, with sandy bottoms; indeed
as compared with yesterday, the soil is much more sandy and less pebbly.&nbsp;
Vegetation is the same, no more dense aggregations of Artemisia fruticosa
are seen, but the plants consisting of scattered Artemisia of yesterday,
barely suffruticose, Peganum, Astragalus, Astragaloid Muscoideus, and
Senecio glaucescens.&nbsp; A good deal of cultivation occurs on both
sides of the slope towards the southern boundary, which is here lofty,
presenting the usual limestone characters.&nbsp; Many villages are seen,
all fortified, and about Jumrat there is the appearance of much population.&nbsp;
Jerboas, ravens, rock pigeons, and wild pigeons, are common; hares are
uncommon.&nbsp; Very few trees are to be seen, but there is abundance
of good water and grass along the margins of the cut.&nbsp; Sheep are
also to be had, but they are small, and goats for one rupee each, large
sheep two rupees: <i>dhal</i>, <i>atta</i>, barley procurable; and Herat
rugs.</p>
<p>To-day the native troops were put on short rations of twelve <i>chatacs</i>;
servants, etc. on eight.&nbsp; Horsemen to the number of 100? came to
meet the Shah, all mounted on decent ponies, but quite incapable of
coping with our irregular horse.&nbsp; Barometer 23.305, thermometer
87&deg;, Wooll. new thermometrical barometer 697.6, old 595.8.</p>
<p>From 11 P.M. to 12 P.M. heavy rain; very heavy for about twenty minutes,
with a threatening aspect in the horizon at 7 A.M. to south by east,
from which direction the rain came: thunder and lightning; latter very
frequent.</p>
<p><i>18th</i>.&mdash;Entered the district of Karabagh, distance to
our present place of encampment from that we had left eight and a half
miles.&nbsp; The road decent, traversing several watercuts, one or two
ravines, and a small stream, indeed water becomes more abundant to-day
than in almost any other march: our direction lay the same as before,
but as we approached the low hills, separating us from Ghuznee plain,
we proceeded more east in order to turn them.&nbsp; The features of
the country are the same, together with the vegetation, the only novelty
being a genuine Statice and a Cruciferous plant, which I observed at
Mookhloor, and a Composita, Echinops spinis radiantibus continued.&nbsp;
The medicated suffruticose Artemisia: <i>Joussa</i> in old cultivation,
and Peganum are the most common plants.</p>
<p>Grass abundant along the cuts and streamlets, mixed with a pretty
new Astragalus, and the Astragalus of Mookhloor, <i>Composita</i> <i>depressa</i>,
etc.</p>
<p>The valley narrowing, we halted at the foot of low hills, which we
are yet to traverse; the ground about our camp stony and barren, producing
Astragalus, thorny Staticoides, Centaurea spinosa, Verbascum, and Thapsus.</p>
<p>The soil of the plain good and deep, as instanced by ravines, and
the deep beds of streamlets.&nbsp; Cultivation is abundant, villages
numerous, and, as usual, all walled; their form generally square, with
a bastion at each corner, and often two at each face, in which there
is a gate.&nbsp; The people are very confident of their own security
in these parts, crowding to our camp with merchandise.&nbsp; The country
continues bare of trees, except about some of the villages; northern
boundary hills lofty; a curious snow-like appearance is occasionally
produced from denudation of land slips, like a long wall running along
one of the ridges: southern hills distant, presenting limestone characters.</p>
<p>The articles sold in camp yesterday, were <i>atta</i> (wheat) eight
seers, barley sixteen <i>chenna</i>, sugar three to four seers.&nbsp;
Lucerne abundant, at one rupee four annas a bullock load, <i>soorais</i>,
<i>kismiss</i>, three to four seers, <i>zurd</i>-<i>aloo</i> twelve
seers, dried <i>toot</i> or mulberry one and a half seers for a rupee,
but these are insipid, very sweet, but also very dirty, <i>pistacio</i>
nuts one seer: crops not yet cut, but ripe.</p>
<p><i>Kupra</i>, cloth of common quality, as well as a black kind called
<i>soosee</i>.</p>
<p>Barometer, mean of three observations (12 P.M., 1 P.M., 2 P.M.) 23.433,
thermometer 85&deg; 6'.&nbsp; Wooll. new therm.&nbsp; bar. mean of two
observations, 699.1, old, 597.5.&nbsp; Lichens abundant on black <i>limestone</i>?
rocks.&nbsp; On hills about camp, Labiata nova, and a curious tomentose
plant were the only novelties.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Argutto, distance nine miles, direction
easterly, the country continues unchanged until we ascended gradually
the end of the low ridge between us and Ghuznee.&nbsp; The slope was
very gradual: the road towards the foot generally sandy, and in some
places very bouldery: on surmounting the ridge, which was not 300 feet
above the plain, we descended a trifle, and encamped in an open space
with hills to the north; this place slopes to the south into the valley
up which we have come for some marches.&nbsp; The valley in this upper
portion is not so fertile as the lower parts we have seen lately, still
there are a good many forts, and some cultivation: one or two cuts were
passed, and water is abundant at our halting place in cuts, or <i>Kahrezes</i>,
as well as in a small torrent with a shallow bed.&nbsp; Several forts
were seen on the north side, situated in the small ravines of the hills,
they are however, mostly ruined.&nbsp; No change in the vegetation.&nbsp;
Jerboas not uncommon.&nbsp; An Accipitrine bird, the same as that obtained
at Shair-i-Suffer.</p>
<p>Horsemen, about thirty, were seen on the hills; they descended thence
and skirted the base in number; when they were pursued by our cavalry,
but escaped through a ravine which Sturt says, leads into a fine plain
with many forts.&nbsp; The 4th brigade joined with the Shah&rsquo;s
force.&nbsp; I observed to-day a curious monstrosity of an Umbelliferous
plant, in which the rays of the umbellules are soldered together; forming
an involucre round the immersed central solitary female, the male flowers
forming the extreme teeth of the involucre.</p>
<p>Detached thermometer 83&deg; 3', attached ditto 83&deg; 3'; barometer
23.262, mean of three observations: old therm. bar. 597.2, new ditto
696.9.&nbsp; Abundance of villages throughout the part of the valley
running east, and then north, and many trees.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p373.jpg">
<img alt="Ghuznee" src="images/p373.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>20th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Nanee, distance eight to ten miles,
bearing north-east; after descending slightly from the ground we encamped
on, and turning the east extremity of its slope, the road is good, sandy
and shingly, running close to low undulated hills.&nbsp; No change in
vegetation.&nbsp; Encamped on undulated shingly ground formed from low
hills to the north, about half a mile off: Ghuznee is thence visible,
situated close under a range of hills, the walls high, having many bastions,
and one angle on the south face.&nbsp; Abundance of villages and topes
or groves about the valley closing up with irregular barren mountains.&nbsp;
Picquets were seen about five miles from our camp, but no appearance
of an army about Ghuznee.</p>
<p>The valley up which we have come since leaving Mookhloor, runs opposite
this place, from nearly east to north, and apparently, terminates beyond
Ghuznee; it is highly capable, is well inhabited and much cultivated.&nbsp;
So are all the valleys that we have seen on surmounting the boundary
ridges: the villages occupy each indentation of the valley, as well
as its general level.</p>
<p>Barometer at 1 P.M. 23.336, thermometer 91&deg;: new thermometric
bar. 697.1, old 597.2.&nbsp; Latitude mean of three observations 33&deg;
24' 26&quot; North.</p>
<p><i>21st</i>.&mdash;Moved to Ghuznee, ten miles six furlongs.&nbsp;
Cavalry in very regular columns on the left; infantry to the right,
and the artillery in the centre; the park bringing up the rear: to the
last moment we were not aware whether the place would hold out or not.&nbsp;
The Commander-in-Chief and staff moved far in advance to reconnoitre
until we entered a road between some gardens, at the exit of which we
were almost within range of the town; here we halted; a fire was soon
set up against us from gardens to our left, and somewhat in advance,
but all the shots fell far short.&nbsp; On the arrival of the infantry,
the light companies of the 16th, the 48th were sent to clear the gardens,
which they easily did, although from being trenched vineyards, walled
and <i>treed</i>, their defence might have been very obstinate.&nbsp;
In the mean time the guns on the south face of the fortress opened on
us, and our artillery forming line at about 800 yards range, opened
their fire of spherical case and round shot in return; other guns in
the fort then opened and a sharp fire was kept up on those in the gardens
by <i>jhinjals</i> and <i>pigadas</i>, who when hard pressed took refuge
in an outwork or round tower.&nbsp; The fire from the south-east extremity
was soon silenced <i>pro</i> <i>tempore</i>, the shrapnel practice being
very effective.&nbsp; The howitzer battery on the extreme left of the
artillery line was too great a range, and with the exception of one
gun, all the shells fell short.&nbsp; In the <i>m&eacute;lee</i>, the
Zuburjur 48-pounder, was dismounted, and carried with it a considerable
portion of the wall of the citadel where it is built upon a scarp in
the east face.&nbsp; After some further firing, the troops were withdrawn
almost without range, but sheltered by gardens and broken ground.&nbsp;
From 9 A.M. the engineers with an escort reconnoitred the place, and
having ascertained that the only practicable point of attack <i>with</i>
<i>our</i> <i>means</i> was the Cabul gate, we were moved off, and marched
to the new ground in the evening.&nbsp; Owing to the difficulty of crossing
a river and several cuts which intercepted the way, and formed the worst
road for camels and guns I have yet seen, much of the baggage was not
up till twelve next (i.e. this) morning.</p>
<p>One European was killed, accompanying the escort.&nbsp; Graves severely,
and Von Homrig slightly wounded, a <i>golundauz</i> lost his leg, and
a few others were wounded.&nbsp; Their gun practise in the fortress
improved much towards the end, and against the reconnoitring party,
was said to be good.</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;The ground we now occupy is the mouth of the valley,
up which the Cabul road runs: our camp stretches obliquely across this;
the Shah&rsquo;s camp taking a curve and resting by its left on the
river.&nbsp; On our (i.e. the sappers) right, is a range of hills, from
the extremity of which the town is commanded; between us and the range
in question, the 4th brigade is stationed, and on the other side, the
remainder of the infantry.&nbsp; We are it seems within reach of the
long gun, which has been remounted, and occasionally directs its energies
against the Shah&rsquo;s camp.&nbsp; The night was quiet, the troops
completely knocked up by the fatigues of the day, the distance we came
(to the right) was certainly six miles, and that by which the infantry
moved to the left, was still more.</p>
<p>The gardens between us and the town are occupied by the enemy, but
the village of Zenrot on the ridge, is not.&nbsp; Large numbers of cavalry
are seen on the other boundary range of the valley, opposite our encampment,
certainly 2,000; this is probably the other son of Dost Mahommud, who
left the fort with the Gilzee cavalry on the night of our march to Ghuznee,
for the purpose of attacking our baggage; they were easily driven from
the ridge, which is now occupied by our horse.</p>
<p><i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Ghuznee was taken this morning by a coup-de-main,
the whole affair was over in half an hour from the time the gate was
blown open; there was, however, a good deal of firing afterwards, and
some of the inhabitants even held out throughout the day, and caused
almost as much loss as that which occurred in the storm.&nbsp; The affair
took place as follows: the guns moved into position between 12&frac12;
and 2&frac12; P.M., and about 3 P.M. commenced firing at the defences
over the gate: under cover of this fire the bags of powder, to the amount
of 800 lbs. were placed against the gate by Captain Peat, the hose being
fired by Lieut. Durand.&nbsp; In the mean time the road to the gate
was occupied by the storming party, the advance of which was composed
of the flank companies of all the European Regiments.&nbsp; The head
of the advance was once driven back by a resolute party of Affghans,
who fought desperately hand to hand, but a jam taking place, the check
was only momentary.&nbsp; After clearing the gate, the enemy must have
become paralysed, and both town and citadel were gained with an unprecedentedly
trifling loss.&nbsp; None of the engineers, or of the party who placed
the bags, were touched, although from the enemy burning blue lights
they must have been seen distinctly: two, of a few Europeans who accompanied
Capt. Peat were shot; one killed.&nbsp; During the day a great number
of prisoners were taken, among whom was Dost Mahommud&rsquo;s son; a
great number of horses also fell into our hands.</p>
<p><i>24th</i>.&mdash;Ghuznee: by this morning at 9 o&rsquo;clock every
thing was quiet, and the last holders-out have been taken; strict watch
is kept at the gate to prevent plunder, dead horses are now dragged
out, and dead men buried: the place looks desolate, but the inhabitants
are beginning to return.&nbsp; It appears to me a very strong, though
very irregular place, the stronger for being so: the streets are very
narrow, and dirty enough, houses poor, some said to be good inside,
it is a place of considerable size, perhaps one-third less than Candahar.&nbsp;
It is surrounded by a wet ditch, of no great width, the walls are tall
and strong, weakest on the north-east angle immediately under the citadel;
parapets, etc. are in good repair.&nbsp; The loop holes are however
absurd, and even when large are carefully screened.&nbsp; The ditch
is crossed at the Cabul gate by a stone bridge.&nbsp; The Zuburjur is
a very large gun, but almost useless to Affghans, who are no soldiers.&nbsp;
Every side of the town might have been stoutly defended.</p>
<p>The view from the citadel is extensive and fine, the mountains to
the north and north-west extremely so, and seem crowded in the view,
while the river and its cultivation add novelty to an Affghan landscape;
many villages are visible in every direction, surrounded with gardens
and orchards.</p>
<p>There is a good deal of cultivation all round the town, which is
situated on a sloping mound, separated by the ditch from the ridge forming
the northern boundary of the valley, up which the Cabul road runs; there
is a small mosque on this ridge, and below it, within 400 yards of the
ramparts, a small village, from which the attack was best seen.&nbsp;
The gardens are as usual walled, and are all capable of irrigation,
the plots being covered with fine grass or clover.&nbsp; Apples, apricots,
pears, and plums much like the Orlean&rsquo;s plum, a sort of half greengage,
bullace, El&aelig;agnus, and mulberries, are the principal fruit trees;
of these the pear is the best, it is small but well flavoured; the others
are indifferent.&nbsp; There are many vineyards dug into shallow trenches:
the plum is allied to the egg-plum, but altogether there are four kinds.</p>
<p>The chief vegetation of the uncultivated ground is a small Salsola,
Salsola luteola, this is mixed with Peganum, Santalace&aelig;, Senecionoides
glaucescens, Umbelliferoid bicornigera, Composita, having the decurrent
part of the leaves dislocated and hanging down.&nbsp; Centaurea spinescens,
Linaria, <i>Joussa</i>, and one or two Astragali.</p>
<p>The vegetation, with the exception of an Artemisia indic&aelig; similis,
a Malvacea, and an Orobanche growing on Cucumis sp., is precisely the
same as that met with from Mookhloor hither, Cichorium, Polygonum graminifolium
natans, and two others, Rumex, Mentha, Epilobium micranthum, Dandelion,
Plantago major, Panicum.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of willow trees; Thermopsis is not uncommon,
Centaurea magnispina and Zygophyllum of Candahar are very common, Sisymbrium,
Lophia, Hyoscyamus, Centaurea cyanea, Tauschia.&nbsp; Magpies, Hoopoes,
Pastor roseus.&nbsp; Corvus corax, etc., along the water-cuts.</p>
<p>Some fine Poplars occur at a village, or rather a Fuqeer&rsquo;s
residence; about one and a half mile to the south-west of the town on
the road to Candahar, and about it, one or two Carduace&aelig;, one
a fine one, to be called C. zamufolia, Pomacea acerifolia, also in gardens:
among the cultivated plants are maize, fennel, aniseed? Solarium, Bangun!
Madder, the beautiful clover of Mookhloor, lucerne, melons, watermelons,
cresses, L. sativum, radishes, onions, beetroot.</p>
<p>There are no ruins indicating a very extensive old city.&nbsp; About
our camp are the remains of bunds and old mud walls; near us, and between
us and the city, are two minars, with square tall pedestals, of burnt
brick, about 100 feet high, and 600 paces apart: there is nothing striking
about them, although they bear evidences of greater architectural skill
than any thing I have seen in the country, excepting the interior of
Ahmed Shah&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; The base is angular, fluted, and equals
the capital, which is but little thicker towards its base.&nbsp; They
are brick, and derive their beauty from the diversity in the situation
of the bricks.&nbsp; The one nearest the city is the smaller, and appears
perfect, it is likewise provided with a staircase: the larger one is
broken at the top of the capital.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;I went to see Mahmoud of Ghuznee&rsquo;s tomb,
which is situated in a largish and better than ordinarily built village,
about two miles from the Cabul gate, on the road to Cabul, at a portion
of the valley densely occupied with gardens.&nbsp; The situation is
bad, and the building which appears irregular, quite unworthy of notice;
it is situated among the crowded houses of the village, and to be found,
must be enquired for.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the obscure court-yard which leads to it, there
is a fine rivulet that comes gushing from under some houses, shaded
by fine mulberry trees; in this court are some remains of Hindoo sculpture
in marble; the way there leads past an ordinary room under some narrow
cloisters to the right, then turning to the left one enters another
court, on the north side of which is the entrance to the tomb; there
is no architectural ornament at all about it, either inside or out.&nbsp;
The room is an ordinary one, occupied towards the centre by a common
old looking tomb of white marble, overhung by lettered tapestry, and
decorated with a tiger skin: over the entrance, hang three eggs of the
ostrich, for which the natives have the very appropriate name of camel
bird, and two shells, like the Hindoo conches, but smaller.&nbsp; The
roof is in bad order, and appears to have been carved.&nbsp; The doors
appear old; they are much carved, but the carvings are effaced; they
are not remarkable for size, beauty, or mass; and appear to be cut from
some fir wood, although the people say they are sandal wood.&nbsp; The
tomb strikingly confirms the idea that the Putans became improved through
their connection with Hindoostanees, rather than the reverse; the tomb
is unworthy of a great conqueror.</p>
<p>I then ascended the ridge, and descended along it to the picquets
on the flank of our camp.&nbsp; This ridge, like all the low ones from
Mookhloor to this place, is rounded, very shingly, and generally on
the northern face, is partly covered with rocks, apparently limestone.&nbsp;
The vegetation presents nothing unusual, with the exception of a very
large Cnicus, Cnicoideus zamiafolius, capitulis parvis, an Umbellifera,
a Scutellaria, Dipsacus; otherwise they are thinly scattered with two
or three Astragali, two or three Artemisi&aelig;, among which A. gossypifera
is the most common, Labiata fragrans of Karabagh, Senecio glaucescens,
Composit&aelig;, Eryngioides, Centaurea alia, magnispin&aelig; affinis,
Santalacea, Leucades, Onosma major, et alia, foliis angustis, Echinops
prima, Sedoides, Cerasus, Canus pygm&aelig;us, Dianthoides alia.</p>
<p>The view from this ridge is beautiful, it shows that three valleys
enter the Karabagh one about Ghuznee, the largest to the eastward; then
the Cabul one, then that of the Ghuznee river.&nbsp; The slope of this
valley from the mountains to the river, presents a very undulated appearance.&nbsp;
The cultivation is confined to the immediate banks of the river, which
is thickly inhabited, and to most of the ravines of the mountains, shewing
that water is generally plentiful.&nbsp; The river is to be traced a
long way by means of the line of villages and orchards which follow
its banks.</p>
<p>The mountains are very barren, much varied in the sculpture of their
outlines, and are by no means so rugged as those of limestone in the
Turnuk valley.&nbsp; The lofty one which presents the appearance of
a wall near its ridge, and of snow, alluded to during the march hither
on the 18th ultimo, is still visible.&nbsp; Considerable as is the cultivation,
it bears a very small proportion to the great extent of waste, and probably
untillable land, untillable from the extreme thinness of the soil and
its superabundant stones.&nbsp; Crat&oelig;gus occurred near Mahmoud&rsquo;s
tomb, also Centaurea cyanea.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;Halted: nothing new; botany very poor; poorer
than ordinary.</p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;Moved to Shusgao, distance thirteen and three-quarter
miles, direction still the same, or, to the north of the star Capella.&nbsp;
The road extends over undulating ground, is cut up by ravines, but easily
traversed, ascending and descending; then crossing a small valley, at
the north-east corner of which the ghat is visible: the ascent to the
mouth of this gorge equals apparently the height attained before descending
into the valley.&nbsp; The pass is narrow, the sides steep but not precipitous;
the hills are not very rugged, and they are generally thinly clothed
with scattered tufted plants; the pass gradually widens, and has a ruin
or remains of a small fort-like building as at the entrance.&nbsp; This
ruin, or fort, looks down into a poorly inhabited, poorly cultivated,
Khorassan valley: road good, with a gradual ascent for one and a half
mile from the exit of the pass, where we encamped, about five miles
on the Cabul side.</p>
<p>The Botany is rather interesting, the general features are the same
as those of the hills round Ghuznee; the most common plants Senecionoides
glaucus, Plectranthus of Mookhloor in profusion, a new densely tufted
Statice very common, Verbascum, Thapsioides, Linaria, Artemisia very
common, Cnici, two or three of large stature, Astragali, two or three,
Asphodelus luteus, Labiata of Mookhloor, Santalacea, Dipsacus, <i>Thymus</i>,
Lotoides, Staticoides major.</p>
<p>In the undulated ground before reaching the valley preceding the
pass, a fine tall Cnicus occurs, also Plectranthus; Peganum is very
common.</p>
<p>About our halting place the same small Artemisia and Composita dislocata
occur in profusion; Cnicus zamiafolius, Dianthus aglaucine, <i>Astragalus</i>,
a peculiar prim-looking species.&nbsp; Leguminos&aelig;, Muscoides two
or three, very large Cnici, Plectranthus, Iris out of flower, Astragali
alii, 2-3.</p>
<p>Cultivation consisting of mustard and very poor crops, of which wheat
is the principal: a few ordinary villages are seen with good and abundant
supplies of water; the country notwithstanding is inferior, as compared
with that about Ghuznee.&nbsp; The soil coarse and gravelly, or pebbly.&nbsp;
Thermometer 47&deg; at 5 A.M.</p>
<p>After descending from the gorge, the summit of which may be estimated
at 400 to 500 feet, the ascent is considerable: barometer standing at
1&frac12; P.M. at 22.323; thermometer 86&deg;; so that the extreme ascent
since leaving Ghuznee has certainly been between 1,100 to 1,200 feet.</p>
<p>The inhabitants are coming into camp with articles for sale, as lucerne,
clover, coarse rugs, and sheep.</p>
<p><i>31st</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Huftasya, eight and a quarter miles,
direction about the same, continuing down a narrow valley with a well
marked and tolerable road, extending over undulating ground, having
a slight descent throughout: the centre of the valley is cultivated,
villages extend up the ravines of the northern side.&nbsp; We halted
near several villages, with a good deal of cultivation around, consisting
of beans and mustard.&nbsp; But few trees are seen about the villages,
and there is no change in vegetation: water abundant from covered <i>kahreezes</i>
or wells, which generally flow into small tanks.</p>
<p>The slope of the southern boundary is undulated, that of the northern
though generally flat and uninteresting, yet near us becomes very bold
and rugged, but its ravines and passes are easily accessible.</p>
<p>Shusgao&mdash;The plants found here about the cultivation, are Achill&aelig;oides,
Asteroides, Plantago major, Hyoscyamus, Tanacetoides, Artemisia, Trifolium,
Taraxacum, Mentha, Phalaris, Rumex, the small swardy Carex of Chiltera,
Astragalus, calycibus non-inflatis, tomentoso villoso, this last with
Composita dislocata is common on shingly plains.</p>
<p>On slopes of hills Leucades, Cerasus canus, pygm&aelig;us rare, Dianthoides,
Plectranthus very common, Cnici 3 or 4, Labiata of Mookhloor, Senecionoides
glaucescens common, Artemisia, sp. very common, Staticoides of Dhun-i-Shere,
Anthylloides, Verbascum.</p>
<p><i>Hyoscyamus</i>.&nbsp; The circumcision of the capsule of this
genus is apparently in connection with the peculiar induration of the
calyx of the fruit; its relations to the capsule is so obvious that
its dehiscence is the only one compatible with the free dissemination
of the seeds, <i>the</i> <i>calyx</i> <i>remaining</i> <i>entire</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Hence</i>? the induration of the calyx should be the most permanent
if it is the cause, but to obviate all doubts, both calyx, fructus induratus,
and capsula circumscissa, should enter into the generic character; the
unilaterality of capsules, and their invariable tendency to look downwards,
or rather the inferior unilaterality, may likewise reasonably be considered
connected with the same structure of calyx, as well as the expanded
limb of the calyx.</p>
<p>The indurated calyx is the cause, because although circumscissa capsula
is by no means uncommon, and in others has no relation to the calyx,
yet in this genus it has such, and should have in every other similar
case.</p>
<p><i>August</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Hyderkhet, distance ten and a half
miles down the same valley; the road is bad and after crossing the undulating
terminations of the southern slope, very stony and bouldery; in several
places it is narrow and uneven.&nbsp; The country is well inhabited,
and very well cultivated, particularly towards the bed of the river,
which is here and there ornamented with trees.&nbsp; Numbers of villagers
are seen on the road as spectators.&nbsp; Beans very abundant, mustard
less so, excellent crops of wheat; the fields are well tilled, and very
cleanly kept: this portion of the valley, though small, is perhaps the
best populated and cultivated place we have yet seen: the descent throughout
is gradual: the boundary hills, at least lower ranges present a very
barren character, covered with angular slaty fragments.&nbsp; Some tobacco
cultivation.</p>
<p><i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Shekhabad, nine miles and six furlongs, direction
north-east by east.&nbsp; The road throughout is rather bad, particularly
in places near the Schneesh river, which has a very rapid current.&nbsp;
We left this on its turning abruptly through a narrow ravine to the
south: towards this, the valley narrows much; we then ascended a rising
ground, and descended as much or perhaps less until we reached the Logur,
a river as large almost as the Arghandab, this we crossed by a bridge
composed of stout timbers, laid on two piers composed of stones and
bushes, and tied together by beams: the cavalry and artillery forded
below, and above the bridge.&nbsp; Crossing the bed which is low and
well cultivated, chiefly with rice, we ascended perhaps 100 feet, and
encamped on undulating shingly ground; we then passed much cultivation
on the road: villages are plentiful, and often placed in very narrow
gorges unusually picturesque for Affghanistan; one scene was especially
pretty, enclosed by the high barren mountains of the southern boundary,
in the distance a village or two, and the Schneesh, with banks well
wooded, and willows in the foreground.</p>
<p>The aspect of the hills, except some of the distant ranges, is however
changed; quartz has become very common among the shingle, with reddish,
generally micaceous, slate: the mountains are rounded, and easy of access:
very poorly clothed with vegetation.&nbsp; The course of the Logur is
nearly north and south.</p>
<p>There are some villages about this place, with lucerne, clover and
bearded rice of small stature.</p>
<p>The elevation of the country is here about 100 feet below our camp,
which is about half a mile from the river.&nbsp; Barometer 182, 23.362;
thermometer 95&deg;; latitude 34&deg; 5' 30&quot;.</p>
<p><i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Halted: the Logur river discharges much water;
the whole of the tillable portions of adjacent banks are not under cultivation,
the rocky sides to the south composed of micaceous slate, are very precipitous;
these mountains were originally rounded, but are now formed into cliffs;
willows and poplars are abundant along the river.&nbsp; But the vegetation
of the cliffy sides scarcely presents any change, except in a Salvia,
a Ruta, a small withered Leguminosa; the other plants are Polygonacea
frutex uncommon, Senecionoides, Salvia Horminum common, Artemisia two:
the usual one very common, Asphodelus, Mesembryanthoides, and luteus,
several Composit&aelig;, two or three Cnicoidei, a Pulicaria, etc. of
the same section, Cuscuta, Linaria angustifolia, Stipa, several withered
grasses, Dianthoides, Scrophularia, Allium, Cerasus canus, pygm&aelig;us
uncommon, Sedoides, Boragine&aelig;, Boraginis facie common, Leucades,
Astragali, three or four, Onosm&aelig; 2, angustifolia and majus, Scutellaria,
Equisetoides, Ephedra.</p>
<p>Anthylloides, Plectranthus common, Peganum uncommon, Staticoides
major, Composit&aelig; dislocata common.</p>
<p>In the swardy and wet spots along river, the usual plants occur;
the novelty being a Hippuris out of flower, Plantago, Glaux, Chara,
Alisma, Tamarisk, Salix, Trifolium fragiferum, Thermopsis, Cyperacea,
Triglochim, Equisetum.&nbsp; The <i>Nuthatch</i> found in the cliffs,
cultivation occurs.</p>
<p>To-day news arrived of the flight of Dost Mahommud to Bamean, with
3,000 Affghan Horse.&nbsp; Captain Outram sent in pursuit.&nbsp; The
Shah joined us, attended by perhaps 2,000 Horse, and people are said
to be flocking into our camp from Cabul.</p>
<p><i>4th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Killa-Sir-i-Mahommud, distance ten
and a half miles, direction north by east, the park of artillery, etc.
remaining behind, the road for the first half extending over undulating
ground to the head of the valley, then becoming level and good with
some inferior cultivation: the valley is dry and barren.&nbsp; We encamped
on stony ground forming a slight eminence under a beautiful peak, certainly
4,000 to 5,000 feet above the plain, and hence 12,000 to 13,000 feet
above the sea.&nbsp; The valley at the base of the hills is occupied
by a few villages, but generally speaking little population exists in
these parts.&nbsp; No change in vegetation; at the level part of the
march the Chenopodiace&aelig; of Karabagh is very common.</p>
<p>The 2,000 Dooranees who joined the Shah yesterday dwindled down to
300 by the evening, and the camp was fired into at night.&nbsp; There
is some cultivation about this, chiefly of mustard, carrots, millet
and Panicum, Setaria.</p>
<p><i>5th</i>.&mdash;To Maidan, distance eight miles? direction at first
as before, but after crossing the river due north, we continued down
the valley, passing some villages and cultivation consisting of beans,
etc.; water being abundant about three miles from camp, forming a small
brook, which falls into the Cabul river at the end of the valley.&nbsp;
Before reaching this we crossed a low spur, and then descended into
Maidan valley: which presented a beautiful view; much cultivation, and
trees abundant along the Cabul river.</p>
<p>Crossing this which is a rapid current one foot deep, twenty yards
wide, running south, or in the contrary direction to that which is given
in Tassin&rsquo;s Map, we ascended an eminence on which a ruinous stone
fort is built, we crossed this eminence between the fort and main ridge
and descended into a valley again, keeping above the cultivation at
the foot of the east boundary range, for about a mile, when we halted.&nbsp;
The ruins of a stone bridge exist over the river, one arch remaining
on the left bank.</p>
<p>The valley is the prettiest we have seen, the hills to the west and
north being lofty and picturesque; one to the latter direction presenting
an appearance exactly like that of snow on its ridge, quite white, but
not changing even at noon, nor occupying such places, as it would do
if it were snow.&nbsp; The mountains, except those to the west, are
not boldly peaked, the valley is prettily diversified with wood, all
of the usual sombre cypress-like appearance, from the trees, especially
poplars, being clipped.&nbsp; Cultivation and water both plentiful:
villages and small forts numerous, with very barren mountains.&nbsp;
This was the place where Dost Mahommud was to have fought; he could
not have selected a better, the ridge entering the valley, and the passage
of the river, as well as that of the fort would have afforded good positions:
a road however runs round the base of the eminence on the river side.&nbsp;
By swamping the valley, or cutting a canal, and entrenching himself
he might have caused great difficulties.&nbsp; Apples are abundant here,
rosy and sweet.</p>
<p>Cultivation of the valley consists of wheat, barley, Cicer, not <i>chunna</i>,
maize, rice, carrots, beans, peas.</p>
<p>The river side is well furnished with willows and poplars, Salix
viminea also occurs; the villages are generally square, with a bastion
at each corner, and loopholes.&nbsp; Cyprinus microsquamatus, <a name="citation383"></a><a href="#footnote383">{383}</a>
common.</p>
<p><i>6th</i>.&mdash;Arghundee, distance eight miles, direction for
the first fourth of the way NE., then considerably to the eastward,
when we soon left the valley and commenced with an ascent over a low
ridge by a vile stony road over undulating ground.&nbsp; On reaching
the ridge a similar descent took place, where the road becomes less
stony, but much intersected by ravines.&nbsp; We encamped about three
miles from the ridge, in a rather barren narrow valley.&nbsp; Nothing
of interest occurred on the road, except Dost Mahommud&rsquo;s guns,
which are the best I have seen in the country.&nbsp; The hills to our
north crowded closely together, the inner ranges are very high, with
the appearance of snow.</p>
<p>Hindoo-koosh is dimly seen in the distance to the eastward.&nbsp;
In some streams water birds, particularly the small kingfisher of India
are seen.&nbsp; The Hoopoe is common, Merops, Pastor, and ravens.&nbsp;
New plants a Boragine&aelig; floribus infundibuliformis, tubiformibus,
l&oelig;ta c&aelig;ruleis, venosa roseis, melons.&nbsp; Snow on the
Hindoo-koosh: rain in the afternoon, and at night a heavy thunderstorm
to the north.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;Kilah-i-Kajee, lies one mile to the eastward: distance
of to-day&rsquo;s march, nine miles? one continued but gradual descent
over a bad, frequently very stony road, not much water.&nbsp; Direction
at first ENE., then on descending into the first valley, due east or
even to the south of east, we encamped in the centre of a well-cultivated
valley; near dense gardens, having good apples; apricots indifferent.&nbsp;
Hindoo-koosh is here more distinctly visible with several ranges interposed;
the outline is rugged, highest point presenting a fine conical irregular
peak towards the south-east.</p>
<p><i>8th</i>.&mdash;Halted: encamped close to gardens and rich cultivation.&nbsp;
The fields are separated by rows of poplars, willows, and El&aelig;agnus;
scenery pretty from abundance of trees with rice fields interspersed
among woods; the umbrageous banks of the rocky river of Cabul, are quite
of unusual beauty for Afghanistan: extensive fields of cultivation lie
in this direction, as well as across the valley in the direction of
Cabul, consisting of rice in great quantities, mixed with much of a
Panicum stagninum, lucerne, carrots, peas, quantities of safflower,
which appears to me to be of a different species, wheat and barley both
cut, the rice is just in flower.</p>
<p>In orchards, hazel-nuts, apples, pears, etc. some of the fruit excellent,
particularly pears, but generally they are coarse; apples beautiful
to look at, but poor to the taste, excellent but too luscious plums,
good grapes, excellent and fine sized peaches, melons as good as those
of Candahar, water melons, cherries of very dark colour.</p>
<p>Some change is to be observed in the vegetation, see Catalogue, two
or three Labiata, an Ononis, an Aconite, Tussilago? etc. among the most
striking, Ammannia and Bergioides, remarkable as tropical forms, but
it is now hot enough for any plant: rice fields crowded with Cyperace&aelig;
and Alisma.</p>
<p>Crat&aelig;gus oxycantha, or one very like it.&nbsp; The poplar here
grows like the Lombardy one, either from cropping or crowding; its leaves
(when young) are much smaller! and at this stage it might easily be
taken for another species.</p>
<p>Heliotropium canus common.&nbsp; The large poplar when young, or
even when matured, has its younger branches with terminal leaves like
the sycamore.&nbsp; The pomace&aelig;-foliis palmatis subtus niveis
of Quettah and Candahar are nothing but this poplar in its young state!!&nbsp;
Nothing can exceed the difference between the two, both in shape and
tomentum.</p>
<p><i>12th</i>.&mdash;Halted since 10th at Baber&rsquo;s tomb, situated
at some fine gardens, or rather groves very near the summer-house of
Shah Zumaun, and to the right of the entrance into the town.&nbsp; It
is a delightful residence, and for Afghanistan, a paradise.&nbsp; There
are some tanks of small size, around one of which our tents are pitched
under the shade of sycamores and fine poplars; the tank is fed by a
fall from a cut above its level, and which skirts the range of hills
at an elevation of fifty feet in some places from its base.&nbsp; The
tomb of Baber is poor, as also is the so-called splendid mosque of Shah
Jehan, a small ordinary open edifice of coarse white marble.&nbsp; In
the gardens, one finds beautiful sycamores, and several fine poplars
both round the tank and in avenues.&nbsp; Below them a Bauhinioid fruit
was found, together with abundance of hawthorn, roses, and jasmines.</p>
<p>The view from this spot is beautiful, as fine as most woodland scenery.&nbsp;
The view from Shah Zumaun&rsquo;s summer-house is also extensive, and
not to be exceeded as a cultivated woodland scene; it is variegated
with green swardy commons, presenting all sorts of cultivation; with
water, villages, abundance of trees, willows, poplars, hedgerows, and
by the grand but barren mountains surrounding it, the Pughman hills,
which must be at least 13,000 feet above the sea.</p>
<p>The entrance to Cabul on this side, is through a gorge flanked by
hills; these to the left are low, those to the right reaching 1,000
feet, through which the Maidan river, here called the Cabul river, runs;
it may be 100 yards wide.&nbsp; The river is subdivided, and crossed
by a ruined stone bridge of many arches, one parapet of which (the outer)
is continuous with the wall before mentioned.&nbsp; The gorge is occupied
by cultivation of several kinds, having the city wall at its termination,
running irregularly across the valley.&nbsp; A village is situated between
the entrance of the gorge and the wall.&nbsp; There are no defences
to the city worth mentioning: one enters immediately into narrow dirty
streets, with here and there a fever-breeding stagnant sewer; while
the streets are narrow, the bazars are good, of good breadth, well covered
in by flat ornamented roofs: the shops are clean, and well laid out.&nbsp;
Shoemakers and leather-workers, and fruiterers, are the most common:
there are armourers, blacksmiths, drapers and bakers.&nbsp; Hindoos
and Mussulmen intermixed, form the population.&nbsp; There is great
bustle and activity, everywhere profusion of fine fruit, especially
melons, grapes, and apples are presented.</p>
<p><i>13th</i>.&mdash;I ascended this morning the ridge above us, up
which the wall runs; the ascent is, after surmounting the summer-house
of Shah Zumaun, considerably steep, and very rugged.&nbsp; The highest
position of the wall is 1,150 feet above the city.&nbsp; It is eight
feet high, and six or seven thick, composed of slabs of the micaceous
slaty stone of the place, cemented by mud, with a parapet of two feet,
generally of <i>kucha</i>, or mud, with loopholes, and bad embrasures.&nbsp;
It is furnished with bastions, but is now in a ruinous state.&nbsp;
It is a work completely thrown away.&nbsp; To the south, the wall bends
eastward, and is continuous with the outworks of the upper citadel;
to the north it dips into the gorge, and re-ascends the hills on the
opposite side.</p>
<p>From the peak, (which is not the highest point of the ridge, there
being two higher to the south, on the nearest of which is a mound, and
a small pillar) a beautiful view is obtained of Cabul, its valley, and
its mountains, together with the far more beautiful valley in which
the army is encamped.</p>
<p>The town itself presents an irregular outline, and is, with the exception
of some gardens towards its northern side, some lucerne fields near
its centre, and one or two open spots of small size, densely crowded
with the usual terraced-roofed, <i>kucha</i>, or mud houses, which are
so close, as to show no streets whatever.</p>
<p>There is not a single conspicuous building in it, with the exception
of the lower Bala Hissar and a mosque of small size on the right bank
of the river, occupying an open space near a garden, which alone renders
it distinct.</p>
<p>The Bala Hissar occupies the eastern corner: its outworks are regular
enough.&nbsp; It is surrounded by the remains of a wet ditch; its works
have been lately improved.&nbsp; Excepting the part occupied by the
Shah, etc. the space is crowded by houses exactly like the town.&nbsp;
The fort to its south and commanding it completely, is the upper citadel,
and is altogether out of repair; this continues the defence formed by
the wall.&nbsp; The walls of the city themselves are not distinguishable,
excepting those of the nearest quarter, occupied by Kuzzilbashes.&nbsp;
The river intersects the town, it is crossed by two, three, or perhaps
more small stone bridges, and runs nearly due east, and may be traced
almost to the foot of the eastern boundary range.&nbsp; From near the
mosque a fine straight road runs NNE. or thereabouts, with avenues of
trees of small size near the town.&nbsp; Two other roads are visible
on the east side; one is continuous with that which runs along the north
face of the lower citadel, it runs due east; and the other slopes towards
this, and meets it about two or three miles from the city at the end
of a low range of hills.</p>
<p>The valley is not so well cultivated as ours, (i.e. the one in which
the army is encamped) nor by any means so well wooded; it appears bare
some way from the city, but this may arise from the stubble of the prevailing
cultivation of wheat and barley.&nbsp; There is abundance of water,
the only distinct <i>Chummun</i> is to the south of the citadel, it
is now under water.</p>
<p>Some low isolated hills or ranges are interspersed in the valley;
of these the largest is that running nearly parallel to the central
road; the next is due north of the city, and midway between it and the
salt-water lake which stretches several miles along the north of the
valley, and which appears to be a large body of water.</p>
<p>The boundary hills are generally fine; to the east is a high scarped
bold range, running nearly due north and south, its terminations being
plainly visible; near its southern end commences the ridge that forms
the oblique south boundary of the valley, and which runs up towards
the south into a fine broadly conical peak, very conspicuous from Arghandab.&nbsp;
To the north are the fine Pughman mountains; these run east and west:
they are of great elevation, and of fine outline, presenting here and
there appearances of snow.&nbsp; To the west is the walled ridge, not
exceeding 1,300 feet in its highest point above the general level; this
is interrupted by the Cabul river, and never reaches such elevations
again; before ending to the north, it sends off a spur to the east.</p>
<p>Beyond the eastern boundary, glimpses of the Hindoo-koosh are obtainable.</p>
<p>To the west, there are no very high hills visible, excepting the
western part of the Pughmans; those of our valley are not exceeding
2,000 feet in height, and are low to the south, in which direction the
Maidan river flows into the valley.&nbsp; Beyond the highest point of
the walled ridge, are several crowded high mountains.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the western hills is not peculiar, Echinops, a
tallish Carduacea, Carduacea alia, Senecionoides, Astragali, Artemisi&aelig;
2, Statice of Dhuni pass.</p>
<p>Leucades, Labiata of Karabagh, Gramine&aelig;, several small Composit&aelig;,
foliis dislocatis, Leguminosa, fructu echinatis, Santalacea, Asphodelus
luteus, Ruta angustifolia, Umbellifera, foliis maximis of Chiltera,
a very stout plant, with a very medicinal gum, a new Polanisioid, a
Centaureoid, and a fine Carduacea are to be found in it.</p>
<p>A Marmot, the size of a large rat, is also found here, the large
specimens are of a reddish tinge, the small ones of a blackish.</p>
<p>The bazars are crowded all day, and in the morning are obstructed
from asses loaded with wood.&nbsp; Most things are procurable; the cloths
seen are mostly the indifferent common kind of cloth related to the
Seikh Puttoo; camel hair <i>chogas</i>, posteens or coarse blankets;
these last indicating very cold winters: there are not many other things
peculiar&mdash;long knives, and the shoes and boots are among the most
so, and wretched silk handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>The most common grapes are the <i>kismiss</i>, a long coarse grape
which answers for packing, a round, very sweet, purple grape, with large
seeds, and small seedless ones intermixed, are all capable of being
much improved by thinning, and a huge, tough-skinned, coarse, purple
grape, of good flavour.</p>
<p>The best peaches have a green appearance, even when ripe; the ordinary
ones are coarse, and not well-flavoured; but the Affghans are quite
ignorant of the art of packing fruit, and hence most are bruised.</p>
<p>Two sorts of apples are common, both rosy; one very much so, but
much inferior to the other.</p>
<p>Pears principally of two kinds, both allied to the common pear in
shape; the large ones are very coarse, but well adapted for stewing.</p>
<p><i>Aloocha</i> excellent for jellies, as also the cherries: most
kinds of plums are now out of season.</p>
<p>The melons vary much in quality, the watermelons are generally better,
and vary less: the muskmelons I have here seen, are ruined by inattention
to the time of gathering; some are very fine, the pulp is never very
deep coloured; it is very rarely green; some of the Kundah sort are
very good; this and the <i>turbooj</i> are both excessively common.&nbsp;
The usual Cucurbita is cultivated, as well as the other common cucumber,
pumpkin, Luffa f&oelig;tida, and L. acutangula.</p>
<p>Cabbages common, beet root ditto, <i>bangun</i> ditto, excellent
spinage (Spinace&aelig;).</p>
<p>All sorts of spices procurable, but they are generally old: sugar
very good, is sold in flat candied cakes, one and a half inch thick;
<i>koorool</i> in small cakes resembling chunam.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>
<p><i>From</i> <i>Cabul</i> <i>to</i> <i>Bamean&mdash;The</i> <i>Helmund</i>,
<i>and</i> <i>Oxus</i> <i>rivers</i>.</p>
<p><i>24th</i> <i>August</i>, <i>1839</i>.&mdash;Left Cabul for Bamean,
and marched to Urghundee.</p>
<p><i>25th</i>.&mdash;To the Cabul river, distance twelve and a half
miles; diverged from the Cabul road at Urghundee Chokey, striking obliquely
across a ravine that debouches into the main valley at this point.&nbsp;
The course of the river ENE. or thereabouts, then we entered a ravine
to the west side of the river, and commenced ascending the pass, which
is not difficult, and although rather steep at first, subsequently it
becomes merely undulated, the surrounding hills of the pass have the
usual character, but are separated by mere ravines.&nbsp; Vegetation
very scanty; Senecionoides very common, as also <i>Joussa</i> and Statice
of Dund-i-sheer; here I noticed the Solora found in the wood at Kilatkajee.&nbsp;
The Barometer at the summit of the pass, 22.148: thermometer 60&deg;.&nbsp;
An extensive view is had from it, up the Cabul river, the valley of
which is well cultivated, but presents nothing very striking in its
neighbouring mountains.&nbsp; Great numbers of sheep passed us going
towards Cabul, also numbers of Patans with their families, all on camels,
than some of which last nothing could be finer.&nbsp; The women&rsquo;s
dress consists of loose gowns, generally bluish, with short waists coming
almost up under the arms, and leggings of folded cloths; they are a
gipsy-like, sun-burnt, good looking people.&nbsp; Numbers of asses laden
with grain were also passed.&nbsp; At the halting place indifferent
apples only were to be had.&nbsp; Slight rain fell in the afternoon
from east, then it became heavier from west.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;Distance eight miles, the road lay along the Cabul
river up a gentle ascent, over undulated ground; features of country
the same, villages, etc., abundant.&nbsp; Heavy rain set in from the
west after our arrival at the encamping ground at 4 P.M., with thunder.&nbsp;
Night hazy, heavy dew.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;To Sir-i-Chushme, distance ten miles, direction
continues easterly up the Cabul river valley: features the same; road
generally good, here and there stony, crossed a large tributary falling
into the Cabul river, from the north at Juljaily, a large village, the
largest in the valley, and very pretty.&nbsp; Poplars and willows in
plenty along river.&nbsp; Near Sir-i-Chushme the valley becomes narrow;
the river passing through a gorge, on the left side of which on rugged
rocky ground, are the remains of a tower.&nbsp; The rocks here are mica
slate, reposing at a considerable angle, occasionally nearly vertical.&nbsp;
The surface is thinly vegetated, Silenacea, two or three <i>Muscoides</i>
(981), Scrophulari&aelig; sp., common, etc. (see Catal. 971, etc.)&nbsp;
Beyond, the valley again widens, presenting similar features to those
just mentioned.&nbsp; To the right side of the valley there is a beautiful
narrow ravine, bounded on the south with springs, to the north by a
noble bleak rugged ridge, with much snow; it has the usual features,
namely, a shingly inclined plane between huge hills.&nbsp; The village
of Sir-i-Chushme is built on a rising ground or small spur, surrounded
by numerous springs which supply the source of the Cabul river; the
bed of which above them is nearly dry.&nbsp; The springs abound with
the usual water plants, a Cinclidotoid moss in abundance, a Celtoid
tree stands over one spring; Peganum continues.&nbsp; A shallow circular
pool occurs at the foot of the hills, on which the village is built;
it is crowded with the peculiar Cyprinid&aelig; of these parts, <a name="citation390a"></a><a href="#footnote390a">{390a}</a>
some of which attain three pounds in weight, as also a small loach.
<a name="citation390b"></a><a href="#footnote390b">{390b}</a></p>
<p>The cultivation throughout this valley is good.&nbsp; The soil is
however heavy, but in places it gives way to a brown mould: rice is
cultivated up to Julraiz, but not beyond, millet (Setaria), Indian-corn,
lucerne, mustard, beet root; beans and peas are very common.</p>
<p>Great pains are taken with watercuts, which are led off into each
ravine that debouches into the valley, at elevations of sixty to eighty
feet above the river; opposite each, the river where led off is bunded
across.&nbsp; The watercuts or courses are in some places built up with
stones.&nbsp; Apricot trees continue, also mulberries near Julraiz,
but they are not productive.</p>
<p>Timber is cut in good quantities, and is floated down in the spring
to Cabul.&nbsp; We continue to meet flocks of sheep and camels with
Patans, Momums, and Ghilzees going to Cabul, thence to Julallabad; after
selling their produce at Cabul, they return in the summer to the same
pasturages.</p>
<p>The oxen used to tread out corn are muzzled: grain is winnowed as
in Europe by throwing it up in the wind, the corn falls nearest the
wind, the coarse chaff next, then the fine chaff.&nbsp; Sir-i-Chushme
is about the same height as the pass into the valley of the Cabul river.</p>
<p>English Scrophularia were observed to-day at Julraiz.&nbsp; We obtained
all provisions cheap at this place, but of very inferior quality compared
to Cabul.</p>
<p>The most common plants are Senecionoides and Plectranthus; Artemisi&aelig;
one or two, some Carduace&aelig;.&nbsp; Very few novelties occur: hedges
of Hippoph&aelig; and roses, Salvia very common to-day; asses were seen
laden with dried <i>Ruwash</i> leaves.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;To Yonutt, twelve miles, continued for a short
distance up the Sir-i-Chushme valley, then we diverged to the north-west,
still following the principal streamlet up an easy defile; on reaching
a beautiful <i>kila</i>, differently ornamented from the usual form,
we diverged along the same ravine much more to the west.&nbsp; We continued
doing so for five or six miles, passing a little cultivation in every
possible spot capable of it, and four or five forts.&nbsp; The ascent
then commenced to be steeper, still continuing up the watercourse which
was very small; this we soon left, passing over five ridges of easy
access, the third being the highest.&nbsp; Barometer 20.365: thermometer
80&deg; at 10&frac12; A.M.; after this we descended the 5th ridge or
kotal, 200 or 300 feet, which is very steep, having a watercourse at
its bottom; direction of stream lies to the north, thence ascending
we again descended gradually over an open stony ridge, until we reached
the fort of Yonutt, where we encamped near a green wet spot, visible
for some distance.</p>
<p>The road here and there was bad owing to stones; except at the last
kotal, or ascent, it was nowhere very steep, but difficult enough for
camels, especially up the ascent of the 1st kotal.&nbsp; It lay up a
ravine not unlike others we have seen, the ascent being considerable,
but gradual, when we left the watercourse, however, we came on a different
country, very elevated (1st kotal not under 10,000 feet), longly <i>undulated</i>,
the mountains generally massive, rounded, here and there rising into
peaks, especially to the south, near Yonutt, where there is a fine ridge
not under 14,000 or 15,000 feet, rugged with spots of snow; the mountains
to north of this are more rounded; slate and limestone abundant, but
not a tree from the base of the 1st ascent.&nbsp; The ascent is very
practicable, the road is made, or artificial in many places, soil soft
and broken: there is water at seven miles from Sir-i-Chushme, and even
at the foot of the 1st kotal, at least there are two or three of the
usual villages; there is one with its wall demolished.&nbsp; Many granite
blocks are strewed on the road.&nbsp; For ponies and horses, even laden,
the road is very easy, but for draft it is difficult.&nbsp; We experienced
a cold cutting west wind from 11 A.M.&nbsp; Grass is plentiful along
all the moist spots, but it is useless as the camels prefer the Carduacea
of this place, though a bad fodder for them.</p>

<img alt="Sir-i-Chushme ridges" src="images/m392.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Not much change was observed in the vegetation for half-way up the
1st kotal or ascent; willows and poplars continue to nearly one mile
from the last village.&nbsp; Here and there along the ravine or streamlet,
Salvia is very common, Senecionoides, Bubonoides on rocky ground, Sinapis,
Verbascum decurrens used in the Himalayas for German tinder, Statice
of Dund-i-Shere, Muscoides of yesterday, Urtica of Cabul, Malva rotundifolia,
Hyoscyamus 1-labiat., Polygonum prostratum of shingly spots, Composita
dislocata, Leucades, Boraginea, Boraginis fasci&aelig; <i>of</i> <i>before</i>.&nbsp;
About Kila Moostaffur Khan a coarse tufted grass, Centaurea oligantha
common throughout, first found at Khilat-i-Gilzee; Onosma major, Cochlearia,
Dianthoides.&nbsp; Chenopodium diclinum, villosa, Astragali 2-3, Cichorum,
Linaria angustifolia, Euphorbia angustifolia, Marrabium, Hyoscyamus
of Quettah, Testucoides annua appears about here, Epilobium minus, Rumex,
Lactuca fol. cost. subtus spinosis, Melilotus, Silene angulata, Arenaria,
calyce globoso inflato, Echinops of Cabul.&nbsp; The water plants are
precisely the same as those of Cabul.</p>
<p>For new plants see Catalogue 980, etc.</p>
<p>Summit of 1st kotal Statice of Dund-i-Shere, Statice grandiflora,
Dianthoides, several Astragali, one with the pinnul&aelig; dentato serratis,
petiola spinosa, a tufted Monocotyledonous plant with terete canaliculate
subulate leaves, <i>Salvia</i>, Gramen alterum, Composita dislocata,
Carduacea, this is the most common plant on the open rounded parts,
while the others occupy the rocky sides of the hills.&nbsp; The vegetation
is however very poor.</p>
<p>Cultivation various, as seen in different stages along the gorge
up to the ascent.&nbsp; Thus, people are seen ploughing for the next
year&rsquo;s crops amidst stubble fields, and lucerne; but above and
throughout the ascent, no crops are cut, while the wheat and barley
on the descent are in the ear: mustard very common.&nbsp; Several encampments
of what are badly called black teal, and paths are to be seen very frequently
over the hills in most directions, together with flocks of sheep.&nbsp;
A large road leading off to the south-west from the summit is seen;
from this our road is well-marked.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;Halted: every tillable spot is made use of about
Yonutt, where there is a fort with forty families.&nbsp; The crops are
chiefly wheat and a four-awned barley, the grain is fine though scanty,
and the plants are of stunted growth.&nbsp; Ravens the same, round-tailed
eagle as at Urghundee, and Percnopterus, wagtails, three kinds of Conirostres,
and an Alauda are found here, one or two Sylvi&aelig;.&nbsp; The sward
about this place is abundant, affords good pasturage for a few horses,
and water is plentiful.&nbsp; This sward is chiefly occupied by a Leguminous
Caraganoid shrub, rather thorny, and not unlike some species of Barberry
in habit, this is abundant, and is first met with in the ravines beyond
the Oonnoo pass, Cyperace&aelig;, viz. 2-3, Carices, small grasses,
Leontodon, Astragaloid c&aelig;rulens, Trifolium album, Composita corona,
Cnicus acaulis, and Gentiana pusilla, compose the sward chiefly; in
the drier parts of it there is a very fine Carduacea, which appears
very local.</p>
<p>The hills about are all either clay slate, pure slate, or micaceous
slate, the strata generally vertical.</p>
<p>Descended the ravine which the rivulet passes down, to where it joins
the Helmund, the hills bounding it are of no great height, but the slips
are sometimes bold.&nbsp; The Helmund runs between rocky cliffs, its
bed not much broader than the stream, the water is clear, rapid, and
the column considerable.</p>
<p>This gorge is picturesque, the sides being generally precipitous.</p>
<p>The plants of these hills are, Umbellifer&aelig; very common, Statice
2, Carduacea, Ephedra, Labiat&aelig; of Karabagh vel similia, Arenarioid
out of flower in the crevices, a large Mattheoloid, Leucades, Dianthoides
foliis undulatis, Artemisi&aelig; two or three, one a peculiar one,
No.--a shrubby Astragalus, stunted scraggy Polanisia of Cabul? Campanula
of Karabagh in the bed of the stream, Cnicus of Kot-i-Ashruf, and Salvia
are excessively common, Artemisia pyramidalis, two or three: mosses
occur on the banks, and several Gramine&aelig;, see Catalogue 1,005,
etc.&nbsp; Cnicus alius, Verbascum.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Helmund gorge" src="images/m393.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;We continued ascending gradually, crossing a low
ridge covered with sward, and then descended to surmount another ridge,
which appeared to me to be as high as the top of the Oonnoo.&nbsp; We
thence descended, crossing several small ridges; and, at about the distance
of five miles from the commencement of the day&rsquo;s journey, suddenly
turned north, entering a gorge of the usual structure, drained by a
small stream, and thence came on the Helmund, not much increased in
size as compared with the point at which we had seen it first, but in
a comparatively wide and partly cultivated ravine, containing three
or four ruined forts.&nbsp; We continued a quarter of a mile down the
Helmund, then ascended up a considerable stream through a similar gorge,
until we reached an encamping spot, after performing thirteen and a
half miles.&nbsp; The barometer at the Helmund stood at 21.206, thermometer
63&deg; in sun.</p>
<p>Kohi-Baba is first seen from the first ridge, but it is seen beautifully
from the second, and still better from some distance beneath this; it
is a noble three-peaked ridge, the eastern peak is the largest, and
of angular, conical shape.&nbsp; The other two are rugged; the central
one is perhaps the highest; the lower portions cliffy, evidently slaty.</p>
<p>The river up which we came after leaving the Helmund, is fully equal
to that in size; it is very rapid: the ravine is very narrow, occasionally
widening into swardy spots.&nbsp; We encamped nearly opposite Kohi-Baba,
the conical peak of which here seems a huge rounded mass, with heavy
patches of snow, particularly along the northern ridge: the second range
to the south is very precipitous and cliffy: at this place a small streamlet
falls into the river from the direction of Kohi-Baba.</p>
<p>No particular change in vegetation is observed: two or three Umbellifer&aelig;,
a Scrophularia, Geranium, Ranunculus aquaticus, Herba immersa, foliis
anguste loratis, Potentilla, <i>Panserina</i>, a new Graminea.</p>
<p>The most common plants are still Carduace&aelig; and Salvia; Rosa
occurs also, (Senecionoides ceased some time before) Statice, Scutellaria
common, Verbascum, Euphorbia linearifolia, Linaria ditto, Mentha: no
change in water plants, or in those of the sward, Chenopod. f&aelig;min.
villos, coarse grass, No. 998, common; the chief new feature is <i>Ruwash</i>,
the dead red leaves of which are abundant.&nbsp; Two villages were passed
after leaving the Helmund, both ruined, yet all spots cultivated, several
with Cicer.&nbsp; Watercourses as high up cliffs and hills as 100 feet
above the river.</p>
<p>A dreadfully cutting dry wind blows down the ravine, and in our faces
all the way.&nbsp; Limestone cliffs occurred, about which the vegetation
became rich, more especially near a bridge consisting of trees thrown
across a narrow portion of the river, at a point where the stream is
very deep; near this are two willow trees of a different species.&nbsp;
A fine Rosa, a new Epilobium, Aconitum, Salisburifolium, a small Crucifera,
one or two Composit&aelig;, a curious Polygonum, a Rumex, a Dianthus,
Silene, three or four Umbellifer&aelig;, among which is the yellow Ferula?
of the Kojhuk pass, two or three new Leguminos&aelig;, Saponaria, Silenacea
inflata, Cerastium may be found among them, or in the fields close by.</p>
<p><i>31st</i>.&mdash;We ascended the high bank or cliff over the bridge,
and continued up the ravine which lies over the river, but whose bed
is too narrow for a road: we passed two or three villages, the road
undulating over ground covered with granite boulders, or rather small
masses, rounded only when exposed to weather; the bottom of each undulation
is covered with sward and giving exit to a small stream; sometimes we
came on the bed of the river.&nbsp; At six and a half miles we came
on a fort, used as a custom house, and diverged again to the east up
a ravine; the Arak road continuing along the river.&nbsp; We passed
another fort, and then commenced the main ascent of Hajeeguk.&nbsp;
In a ravine to the left, 100 feet above us, was a large mass of half
frozen snow: barometer at the foot of main ascent 20.320, thermometer
80&deg;.&nbsp; The ascent is rather steep, but easy enough: barometer
19.755, thermometer 80&deg;.&nbsp; Thence the descent was steep for
about 800 feet, and then gradual for four or five more, when we encamped
on sward.&nbsp; From the top of the pass we had a beautiful view of
the <i>ridge</i> of Kohi-Baba, running about WNW., presenting a succession
of fine bold rugged peaks, the conical mass was not seen well, as there
is heavy snow on it, and on some other parts of the ridge.</p>
<p>Water is plentiful in all ravines, the lower parts of which are covered
with swardy grass.&nbsp; Cultivation is less advanced than at Yonutt,
consisting chiefly of barley; every capable spot is made use of.&nbsp;
Boulders of antimony, also a large mountain close to, and on the right
of our camp composed of this ore, which is very heavy; a ruined fort
on the hill near us, shewing again how some of these ridges become disintegrated.&nbsp;
A <i>cafila</i> passed with huge loads of cloths of various sorts, carried
on asses, going to Bamean: they paid toll I observed at Choky fort.</p>
<p>The vegetation in the snow ravine was rich, and varied in the swardy
spots: Ranunculi 2, Swertia 2-3, Gentiana a fine one, Junci, Carices,
Euphrasia, Triglochin, Veronica as before, Cardaminoides; near the snow
in sward, a pretty Primula in flower; two other Pediculares.&nbsp; A
Brynum on the dry parts of the ravine, two Astragali in flower 2-3,
Crucifer&aelig;, Echinops, Carduace&aelig;, Silene pusilla, Stellaria,
Campanula odorata, Rutacea about springs, Parnassia? Astragali 3-4,
in flower, long past this elsewhere, Thalictrioides, Secaloides.</p>
<p>See Catalogue Nos. --- of exposed face; Staticoides of Yonutt, Gramin&aelig;
998, Carduace&aelig; very common, Statice ali&aelig; rare.</p>
<p>The hill over which the pass runs, is chiefly covered with a herbaceous
Carduacea out of flower in profusion, one or two Astragali, an Artemisioid,
small Composit&aelig;, and the abundant Carduace&aelig; of Yonutt, Astragaloid
pinnulis on the west side, <i>Koollah</i> <i>hujareel</i>, Statice,
Macrantha dentatis; a spinous leaved Carduacea, different from the Zamea
leaved ones out of flower, Gramin. 998 common, Chenopodioid? Arenaria
spinosa, Onosma, Carduacea alia, two or three Astragalus primus.&nbsp;
Altogether the vegetation is different from that of Oonnoo, in the comparative
absence of Statice, Dianthoid, and Astragali.</p>
<p>Similar swardy spots occur on the west of the pass, a large Swertia,
Caraganoid, Carices, etc. as before, Gentiana of Yonutt, a new Potentilla,
Salix fruticosa; here also occurs the first Orchidea I have seen in
Khorassan: it belongs to the tribe Orchis, but is out of flower.&nbsp;
On the 1st of Sept., I re-crossed Hajeeguk, directing my way again into
the snow ravine from the top of the pass, and found a number of plants,
for which see Catalogue.&nbsp; A Campanula abundant about springs at
12,400 feet.&nbsp; The vegetation of the ravine close by the little
fort is rich, and would repay two or three days&rsquo; halt, as it runs
a long way up the antimony hill, Swertia in profusion, Geranium also,
Stellaria, a fine Conyzoidia.</p>
<p>I had here an opportunity of observing the curious effect of a patch
of snow in retarding vegetation, all the plants about, being as it were
a spring flora, even such as at similar elevations elsewhere, were all
past seed; such as Astragalus primus.&nbsp; Again, why do some plants
flower sooner at such elevations than at other lower places? such as
Cardamine, here past flower, but not commencing at Cabul; is it because
this plant will flower in the winter in Cabul? so there may be a law
requiring such plants to flower in wintery situations by a certain time?&nbsp;
The idea is perhaps absurd, as their growth depends exclusively on the
power of the sun.</p>
<p><i>September</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;After re-crossing Hajeeguk we
continued our march to Sohkta, five and a half miles.&nbsp; The road
continued along a considerable descent throughout, at first down the
valley in which we had halted to the west, thence down the large Kulloo
valley in a northerly direction; towards the mouth of first ravine or
valley it is bad, passing across a land slip, then it crosses the bed
of a huge torrent falling at a great rate, and obstructed with boulders;
the right bank, a high almost precipitous mountain, the left a high
aggregate of granitic and other boulders.&nbsp; Water abundant, divided
into three streams or so: this torrent comes direct from the nearest
portion of Kohi-Baba, which appears of easy descent, presenting beautiful
peaks.&nbsp; The road then keeps along left bank, undulating over the
ravines, down which water flows from the hills on the eastern side;
some of these are very steep, and the road itself is infamous, as may
be supposed, crowded with boulders, and impracticable for wheeled carriages:
one precipitous ravine we passed through, the rocks consisted of blackish,
curiously laminated, and metallic looking stone.&nbsp; On descending
one steep ravine, we then came on the road leading up to the Kulloo
mountain, where we halted.</p>
<p>A good many villages, with forts, as usual were passed; the cultivation
more advanced than at our last halt, crops consisting chiefly of barley.&nbsp;
One good fort was observed close to our halting place opposite the direction
of the small Kulloo ravine; across the valley a well marked road is
seen running up a part of Kulloo ridge, at a lower elevation than that
which we crossed.</p>
<p>Poplars and willows occur in the large valley, particularly towards
Sohkta, a small orchard of stunted mulberry trees.&nbsp; Cultivation
consisting of peas; barley of fine grain, resembling wheat when freed
from the husk.</p>
<p>The plants of the valley of Kulloo were badly observed, as I was
greatly tired and fatigued.&nbsp; Polygonum fruticosum re-occurs, Silene,
Clematis erecta, Tragogopon, Salvia but less common, a curious Cruciferous
plant, Lactucacea purpurea of Cabul, Chenopodium villosum f&aelig;min.&nbsp;
Dianthus, Saponaria, Lychnis inflata, oats common in fields, the common
thistle, Urtica, Caragana abundant along the bed of the river, Papaver.&nbsp;
On rocks about camp, 2 Salsol&aelig;, Glaucum, Umbellifer&aelig; of
the Yonutt ravine, Artemisi&aelig;, Rosa <i>Ribes</i>! Scrophularia
alia.</p>
<p>The valley is very narrow at camp, the river running between precipices,
in some parts passable without wetting the feet.</p>
<p><i>2nd</i>.&mdash;From Sohkta Kullar-Rood to Topehee, eight and a
half miles.&nbsp; The road lay in a northerly direction for a quarter
of a mile, then turning up a steep ravine, with an ascent for 800 feet;
then small descent, then levellish, until we came to a black cliff,
over which another steeper but longer ascent extended, then it became
levellish for some distance; two other moderate, extended, longish ascents,
led us to the summit, which is 500 feet higher than that of Hajeeguk.&nbsp;
The descent continued steep and most tedious on reaching the precipitous
ravine of Topehee, the road wound over small spurs, until we came to
a grove of willows near the village.&nbsp; The road although steep is
not bad, the soil being soft, that of the upper parts and of the descent,
even annoying from the sand, both might with little trouble be made
easy, but especially the descent.</p>
<p>The mercury of the Barometer on the summit at 11 A.M., stood at 19.513,
at 11&frac12; A.M., 19.506, Thermometer 66&deg;.</p>
<p>The camels all came up but one, though very slowly; to them as to
us, the descent was more tiring than the ascent.</p>
<p>From the summit a fine view of Kohi-Baba was obtained, running to
NW. by N.&nbsp; To the NE., another high range, but not so marked as
Kohi-Baba, was seen running in a similar direction; on this, two considerable
peaks present themselves, but only visible when lower down.</p>
<p>A splendid view of the Bamean valley is here obtained.&nbsp; We have
now obviously passed the highest ranges: to west where the country is
low and flat; to the north, the mountains indistinctly visible, are
beautifully varied, presenting rugged outlines 10,000 feet above Bamean,
also a view of an unearthly looking mountain, most variedly sculptured,
is obtained, with here and there rich ravines and columnar sided valleys,
presenting tints very varied; in those of the lower ranges, rich rosy
tints are predominant; also niches in which gigantic idols are plainly
seen: also a view of Goolghoolla, looking as it is in reality, a ruined
city: a fine gorge apparently beyond the Bamean river, and a large ravine
due north, by which I expect the Bamean river reaches the Oxus; not
a tree is to be seen, except a few about Bamean.&nbsp; The whole view
is indescribably volcanic, barren yet rich, requiring much colouring
to convey an idea of it.</p>

<p>To the top of the pass it is three and a half miles; the character
of Kulloo mountain is different from that above described, it is rounded,
and composed of a curious compact slate, towards the summit well covered
with plants, large tufts of Statice, two or three kinds, two undescribed;
immense quantities of Artemisia, coarse tufted grasses, Onosma, Carduacea
herbacea of Hajeeguk, uncommon; Triticoides 998, not common; Alium fusco
purpurea common.&nbsp; A few exposed rocks occur on the summit.&nbsp;
The ravines are all dry, there being no water or very little in them,
and no cultivation; thus the contrast visible on both sides of the Kulloo
river which runs round the foot of the mountain, is remarkable.&nbsp;
Vegetation being distinct on either side.</p>
<p>Yet the ravine of Topehee shows, that when exposed to the action
of water, this rock becomes very precipitous, cliffy, easily dislocated:
the latter part of the road winds over a portion of this.&nbsp; Chakor,
Ptarmigan a fine bird, voice somewhat like that of a vulture, to which
it is perhaps anologous.</p>

<img alt="Topehee cliffs and ravine" src="images/m399.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The same vegetation continues down to Topehee; on the red hills over
its ravine, the plants are different.&nbsp; Portulacea cana, several
pretty Salsol&aelig;, a Polanisia occurs, with Statice two or three,
a straggling Astragalus, Ferula, Peganum re-appears! Cerasus canus,
Carduacea Frutex of Mailmandah, fructibus combretiformibus, Muscoides
which is a Sedum, Polygon. fruticosum common, the usual plants of cultivation,
etc. etc.</p>
<p><i>3rd</i>.&mdash;We proceeded from Topehee to Bamean, a distance
of twelve miles, for two and a half miles down Topehee ravine.&nbsp;
The road is a decent descent, although steepish: from thence turning
abruptly at the Bamean valley, we cross the river, which is of considerable
size, but fordable, although rapid.&nbsp; The road then extends along
the left bank, not in the valley which is occupied by cultivation, but
winding over and round the bases of low hills and cliffs, forming a
northern boundary; throughout this part the road is villainous, often
impeded by huge blocks.&nbsp; After a distance of about ten miles it
improves, the valley expanding into a cultivated plain.</p>
<p>Topehee valley narrows towards its mouth or exit, which is walled
in by high, red, raviny cliffs; above, in its upper parts it is well
cultivated with beans, barley, wheat, and oats, and contains two villages:
it opens into the Bamean valley at a village also called Topehee, there
the Bamean valley is well cultivated, with oats intermixed with barley
or wheat, trefoil, etc., it then narrows, forming the bed of a ravine
occupied by Hippoph&aelig;, Tamarisk, etc., then it widens again.</p>
<p>The structure of the hills is curious, and generally exhibiting the
appearance of having been much acted on by water.&nbsp; They are often
cliffy, composed either of limestone or a soil of red clay, with which
salt occurs in abundance, conspicuous from the white appearance, or
springs.&nbsp; Crystals of carbonate of lime are frequent, limestone,
or coarse conglomerate with large rounded stones, occurs; together with
a curious laminated clayey rock, with white and ochraceous layers intermixed.&nbsp;
The tints most various, as well as the sculpture of the mountains: here
ravines representing tracery occur: there, columnar curiously carved
cliffs, exhibiting all sorts of fantastic forms: here, as it were, a
hill thrown down with numberless blocks into the stream, scattered in
every direction; and here, but this is rare, very red horizontal strata,
colours various, generally rosy, especially the clayey cliffs: here
and there the colour of the rock is ochraceous, at one place its structure
is slaty.&nbsp; The curious intermixture of these colours owing to the
weather, is striking.</p>
<p>From the head of two of the ravines by which considerable torrents
flow into Bamean river, beautiful views are obtained of the Kohi-Baba,
whose peaks according to native authority, stretch sixty miles to the
westward of Bamean, without much diminution in height.&nbsp; The scenery,
however, is less beautiful after emerging into the widened part of the
valley, where the hills are less varied both in form and tints, than
they are in lower parts: fine views however of Kohi-Baba are occasionally
had.</p>
<p>Salsol&aelig; are the prevailing plants of the rocky sides of the
valley, Clematis erecta common, here and there a small Statice.</p>
<p>Caves occur throughout the wide portion of the valley, but chiefly
on the northern side; they also extend a little way into the narrow
portion, where they seem to be excavated into clayey-looking, red, earthy
limestone, or more commonly conglomerate, of coarse grey, or reddish
colour.</p>
<p>The caves are most common in two cliffs composed of conglomerate
mixed with transverse strata of the same rock, 3,400 feet high, presenting
a rugged outline; and between the two, which are 800 yards apart, large
idols are carved.&nbsp; These cliffs in some places have suffered little
from the action of the elements, as testified by the perfect nature
of the opening of the caves, and the corners, etc. of the niches enclosing
idols; in others they are furrowed by the action of water; in others
again slips have taken place to such extent in some, as to cause the
fall of all their caves, or of their greater portion, thus exposing
the galleries, etc.</p>
<p>The base of the cliffs is irregular, formed of the same conglomerate
and clay, but covered more or less by boulders, evidently brought down
by the river; by these many caves are choked up, so that originally
the cliff might have been perpendicular to the edge of the base, and
if so, the caves in the cliffs, and the idols, are of later date than
those of the rugged base.&nbsp; But more probably the cliffs, and the
caves, are much as they were originally, the boulders having been a
subsequent deposit.</p>
<p>The western corner of the cliff beyond the large idol, is much destroyed;
on this, the force of the current would have acted: a breakwater occurring
along the returning face.</p>
<p>The caves are very numerous, but are confined chiefly towards the
base of the cliffs, not scattered over them as I believe Burnes represents.&nbsp;
These are of no size, finish, or elegance, and it is only their number,
and the extreme obscurity of their history, that makes them interesting;
the roofs are usually arched, and the walls are often supplied with
niches, and covered with a coating of tar of some thickness, and intense
blackness.&nbsp; The galleries are low, arched, and admit one person
at a time, or a line of persons with ease; they often form the ascent
to the upper caves now inhabited, but originally they were enclosed
in the rock, they are defended in such cases by a parapet.</p>
<p>The largest caves are those about the idols, but I see none of any
size.&nbsp; They are often domed, the spring of the dome is ornamented
with a projecting frieze, some of these are parallelogramic, in one
instance with an ornamented border thus.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m402.jpg">
<img alt="Part of a frieze in caves near Bamean" src="images/m402.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Some of the caves are situated as high as, or even above the tops
of the idols; all parts within the rock are lighted by small apertures.</p>
<p>Access to the large idol is destroyed; the smaller one is gained
by a spiral staircase of rude construction, and by galleries.&nbsp;
The floor of the galleries is rugged, the steps and the cement of the
conglomerate having worn out from between the masses of rock.&nbsp;
The images all occupy niches in the face of the hill: two are gigantic,
the rest not very large.&nbsp; They are generally in the usual sitting
posture, and rather high up, while the larger ones are erect, and reach
the base of the cliffy portion of the rock.&nbsp; They are all male,
and all obviously Boodhistical; witness the breadth, proportion, and
shape of the head, and the drapery; both are damaged, but the smaller
is the more perfect, the face of the large one being removed above the
lower lip; the arms are broken off, showing they were occupied by galleries.&nbsp;
The drapery is composed of plaster, and was fixed on by bolts which
have fallen out, leaving the holes.&nbsp; The arms in the smaller one
are supported by the falling drapery.&nbsp; The height of the large
image in the niche is 135 feet.</p>
<p>The pictures are much damaged, the plaster on which they were painted
being mostly very deficient, all the faces are damaged by bullets or
other missiles: their execution is indifferent, not superior to modern
Burmese paintings; the colours however are good, the figures are either
grouped or single, and one is in the style of the time of Henry VIII,
with a hat and plume, others represent groups flying&mdash;one a golden
bird, another a man with a hemispherical helmet, all are much damaged.&nbsp;
The hair in some is dressed as in the modern Burmese top-knot, often
surrounded by a circle.</p>
<p>Otherwise the niches are not ornamented, except in one instance,
as above alluded to; the head of the smaller figure was formerly covered
by the roof, as evident from holes or troughs for timbers in the gallery.&nbsp;
These holes are now inhabited by pigeons, and the lower ones by cows,
donkeys, fowls, kids, dogs; some are filthy apertures blocked up by
stone and mud walls; the doors irregular, and guarded between two giants.</p>
<p>An old tope occurs near some small figures, it is composed of stones
very much disintegrated, with curious blocks of <i>kucha</i> work, and
large Babylonish bricks; the smaller figures are much destroyed, some
completely; all are in alto-relievo.</p>
<p>The plants about Topehee valley, are Cichorium, Centaurea lutea,
Berberis common, Salvia, Cicer cultivated, Lucerne, Centaurea angustifolia,
Cnicus of Koti-Ashruf, ditto of Karabagh hills, Triticum, Asteroides,
Avena, Centaurea glauca, the common thistle, Ephedra, Mentha, Rumex,
Melilotus, Medicago, Artemisia pyramidalis, Lychnis inflata, Saponaria,
Bromus, Verbascum, Cerasus canus, Ferula, Statice, Salsola, Astragalus,
Polygonum fruticosum, Composita dislocata, Clematis erecta, Clematis
alia, Echinops, Leucades, Pulicaria fragrans, Hyoscyamus parvus, rare;
Geranium, Rosa, Fabago of Maidan, fructi echinatis, Arundo, Hippoph&aelig;.</p>
<p>Halted at Bamean till the 6th, and inspected Ghoolghoola or Bheiran,
which presents extensive ruins: those of the city are almost destroyed;
but those of the citadel are more perfect, and situated on a mound 300
feet high, which still stands with steep banks or fortifications, apparently
of Kafir origin, generally <i>kucha</i>, with bases formed of boulders.&nbsp;
Three lines of defences remain on the valley side; and the remains of
a ditch 50 feet broad at the mound on the east side.&nbsp; <i>Pucka</i>,
or burnt bricks are common among the debris, also pottery, but this
is of the ordinary sort: I observed but few <i>pucka</i> bricks in the
fortification on the west side.&nbsp; Great masses of rocks have been
thrown about near the building of the fort, and some of the lower bastions
were built on these masses.&nbsp; The mound is chiefly occupied by Salsolace&aelig;,
some of which exist in profusion.&nbsp; Nothing seems to be known about
the history of the place, except that it was built by <i>Julal</i>,
to whom the Mahommedans fix <i>Ud</i>-<i>deen</i>.</p>
<p>Quails are abundant in the fields about Bamean; it is a curious thing
that in many of these fields oats far preponderate over other grain;
yet they are not cut, although all the seeds have fallen out of the
ear!&nbsp; Can it be cultivated solely for the straw?</p>
<p>Fine groves of poplars occur about certain portions of the valley;
from beyond this to the south, a beautiful view is obtained, embodying
the cliffs with the large image, and the back hills whose varied surface
and tints it is impossible to describe, so as to convey a correct idea
of their fine effect.&nbsp; The poplar grove contains some ordinary
Mahomedan <i>tombs</i>.&nbsp; The trees are the P. heterophylla, but
the leaves are much smaller and more silvery underneath than usual;
a beautiful poplar of large size and unencumbered growth, of the same
sort occurs in the ravine beyond the small image.&nbsp; Abundance of
wild sheep&rsquo;s heads are preserved about all the sanctified buildings,
together with a few of those of the ibex, and fewer of the wild goat.&nbsp;
The plants of Bamean require no specification, the hills are very barren,
chiefly occupied by Salsole&aelig;, of which 6 or 7 species occur.</p>
<p>The water plants continue the same as at Cabul; Hippurus and Triglochin,
Mentha, Cochlearia, Naiad? Potamogeton of Siah-Sung, Polypogon.</p>
<p>The other plants are those found in cultivation, and present no change,
Anchusoides alba, abundant.&nbsp; Choughs very abundant; wild pigeons,
ravens, Laurus; the nuthatch, a noisy but not unmusical bird, Chakor,
together with small partridges, but these are rare; several Conirostres.</p>
<p>The greatest curiosity is a genuine trout, <a name="citation404"></a><a href="#footnote404">{404}</a>
this appears rare, the spots are very bright, the largest caught was
only six pounds in weight.&nbsp; I could not take any even with the
fly; but I caught with this, Schizothorax, or one of the universal Khorassan
Cyprins.</p>
<p>The range of the thermometer is great; before sunrise it varies from
28&deg; to 30&deg;! in the sun in midday it is 100&deg;! when there
is no wind, and the mornings are delightful.</p>
<p>One of the long-tailed clumsy Brachypodiums occurs in the fields:
bears also are found here.</p>
<p><i>Joussa</i>, Mentha, Tanacetoid, Polypogonum, Cichorium, Plantago,
common thistle, Potamogeton longifolium, Labiata arvensis of Yonutt,
Centaurea lutea, Cyanea angustifolia, Cochlearia, Hippuris, Ranunculus,
Potamogeton pectinata, Triglochin, Convolvulus arvensis, acaulis, Glaux,
Capparis of Arghandab, Centranthera pinnatifida, Malva rotundifolia,
Asteroides, Lactuca purpurea.</p>
<p>Salt is obtained in some places from the red earth, as also alum
an earthy substance of a whitish or brown colour, and irregular surface,
sent in quantities to Mindosh, called Zak.</p>
<p><i>6th</i>.&mdash;To Zohawk, down the valley two miles beyond the
mouth of Topehee ravine, or embouchure of the Kulloo-Rood.&nbsp; The
angle is occupied by a Kafir fort called Kojhuk, of very large size,
situated on a precipitous dusky-red and very high rock, facing towards
both rivers; the defences reach down the eastern face of rock to the
Kulloo bed, and are in good preservation, more ornamented than the modern
fort, and better proportioned.&nbsp; A pretty grass sward occurs here,
with Tamarisk.</p>
<p>The fort must have been of great size, and is chiefly weak, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.
to a native army, from depending on the river for supplies of water,
for it is commanded from the opposite sides of either ravine.&nbsp;
The bed of the river under the east face, presents the remains of outworks
to protect the supply of water, which is perhaps a sign of its being
a recent structure?</p>
<p>The works are good, much better than those of the Affghans, the view
of the fort from half a mile down the Bamean river, with the sun gilding
the ruined battlements, while the precipice contrasts with it its dusky-red
colour, is beautiful.</p>
<p>The Bamean river, especially after receiving the Kulloo-Rood, is
of considerable size, but fordable at the head of most of the rapids,
its course is rapid, and its waters greyish, while those of the Kulloo
are quite colourless; its bed is of some width, presenting a capital
road over green sward, with plenty of willows, Lycium, Hippoph&aelig;,
Berberis, and Tamarisk.</p>
<p>About one mile east of our camp, its ravine turns to the south.&nbsp;
Wild ducks, quails, chakor, and trout occur whose haunts are in holes,
and taking the worm are easily caught.</p>
<p>This fort of Kojhuk is as well worth examining as any place we have
seen, the dusky-red rocks are coarse conglomerate.&nbsp; A violent wind
prevails up the ravine, commencing about 2 P.M.&nbsp; A curious staircase
situated at the corner towards Bamean, ascends through rock, the bottom
of which is defended by a bastion and round wall; near, or close to
this a slip has occurred, destroying part of the wall and blocking up
one exit.</p>
<p>Ascended the cliff by the gateway of the Kulloo valley, and found
the line of fortifications, with good loop-holes and parapets extend
two and a half miles up, a few houses likewise occur.&nbsp; The path
leads through the face of the solid rock: abundant defences, with arched
buildings occur above: this cliff is almost totally separated from the
upper citadel by a ravine: the citadel has four lines of defences surmounting
a steep ridge with outworks on the Kulloo river, the bed of which is
60 yards broad.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Erak, six miles.&nbsp; We crossed
the Kulloo-Rood, and immediately ascended its right bank, 100 feet high;
then descended into the ravine up which we continued, then leaving it
we struck over the spur of a high mountain; the ascent being about 1,000
feet, thence we commenced a steep descent, of 5,600 feet into the Erak
valley, up which we proceeded for two miles distance and encamped.&nbsp;
From the top of the pass, a fine view is obtained of Kojhuk, and the
valley of the Bamean river, presenting a rich and varied surface beyond
description, with beautifully sculptured rocks, of purplish-red colour,
which are seen up the Kulloo, close to Kojhuk.</p>
<p>The hills and ravines are however very barren, nothing but Salsola
occurs.&nbsp; At the top of the pass a section is partly laid open,
shewing a mass of conglomerate, twenty to thirty feet thick, resting
on red clay.&nbsp; This conglomerate being less acted on by water than
the clay, the rocks often assume curious shapes, and are occasionally
even fungiform.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m406.jpg">
<img alt="Sculptured rocks near Kojhuk" src="images/m406.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>We observed here a new partridge, at least one to which we were not
accustomed; it is almost the size of chakor, black on the back, with
a grey neck, and very shy; chakors abundant here in coveys.&nbsp; The
valley of the Erak is very narrow, but well cultivated, and with a good
many villages.</p>
<p>All the mountains in this direction have rounded shapes or outlines,
the precipices variously curved, the surfaces are thus formed by the
action of water on the outer strata; when this is once exposed, the
changes appear often rapid, as may be imagined in a country of such
low winter temperature.&nbsp; Caves occur in the Erak valley, chiefly
situated in a dirty white conglomerate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m407.jpg">
<img alt="Erak ravine" src="images/m407.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>8th</i>.&mdash;Halted and encamped eight miles up the Erak ravine
on a swardy spot: the road easy, ascent bad in some places, but generally
good, particularly for the latter part of the march: the rocks in some
places rising in abrupt rugged cliffs, generally rounded, slaty.&nbsp;
We passed one mass of snow about two miles from camp, botany good, especially
about the snow; so much so, that it employed me all day.</p>
<p>Caragana appears at about 10,000 feet, a Tamerioid of large stature
in abundance, Asphodelus, not as I thought a Mesembryanthemum, but a
beautiful and very distinct species; see Catalogue for other plants.</p>
<p>Our camp is within one and a half mile of the head of the Erak ravine,
where snow occurs in two large masses; patches of snow also occur on
the ridge or a little below it; these ridges rise about 1,200 to 1,500
feet above us.</p>
<p>Unsettled evening, snow during night on all the ridges about us with
frozen sleet in camp.&nbsp; Thermometer at 6 A.M. 31&deg;.</p>
<p>Large round-tailed eagle seen.</p>
<p>Barometer 20.164, thermometer 61&deg;; boiling point of Wollast.
new thermometer; barometer 650, old ditto 555.3.</p>
<p>Swardy plants.&nbsp; Parnassia, Swertia, Gentiana, Carices, Composita

<p><i>9th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Kurzar, eight miles up a ravine to
the left or eastward, about one and a half mile, then the steep ascent
of the pass; thence the descent was as steep for 800 feet, then gradually
down a swardy ravine until we came to the Kurzar ravine, which we followed
till we reached the Choky.&nbsp; The road good; the ascent for 1,000
feet is very steep, the soil good, hills rounded, here and there slate
rocks outcropping.&nbsp; No change in vegetation.&nbsp; Passed a mass
of snow: abundance of snow on the summit where the mercury in the Bar.
stood at 19.200; thermometer 58&deg;; boiling point of Wollast. new
thermometer; Bar. 648.5, old 539.1, this being the highest spot we have
visited.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the summit presents no change from that of the
rocks and hill sides 1,500 feet below.&nbsp; There is a good deal of
vegetation, Carduace&aelig;, Statices, Astragali, a few tufted grasses
forming the great bulk, <i>Nakhood</i> rare on the Kurzar side, 500
feet down, Statice becomes most abundant, it is curious that on the
sward of this side, neither Fumariace&aelig;, nor Campanula were observed,
Silene fimbriata one species.</p>
<p>Caragana all about, even at Kurzar in ravines; Primula abundant,
also Swerti&aelig;, generally all four plants are found at the Hajeeguk
snow ravine, and may be found between this and Erak, with some interesting
novelties.&nbsp; The distance to Bamean by both routes is within two
miles of the same, the Kulloo-Rood being the shorter, but Hajeeguk the
best road.&nbsp; That of the Kulloo river is followed to Zohawk.&nbsp;
The weather unsettled with showers of hail, clouds and sunshine: and
heavy gusts of wind occasionally from Kohi-Baba, whose eastern extremity
comes in sight after entering the <i>Kurzar</i> ravine.&nbsp; No view
from the summit of the pass.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<p>Pedicularis, Campanula, Rubiace&aelig;, Hippuris in flower, Phleum,
Carduacea of Yonutt, Cnicus of Koti-Ashruf, Pulmonaria, corolla tubiform.&nbsp;
Euphorbia linearifolia, Composita dislocata, Cardamina lutea.</p>
<p><i>10th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to the Helmund, thirteen and a half
miles; the only novelty met with is a curious spring about half-way
between Siah-Sung halting place, and the Helmund consisting of limpid
water emitting a copious ebullition of gas, not water, as the overflow
is very small; a copious deposition of fine red earth is formed all
round, which looks especially bright in the springs themselves.&nbsp;
The water possesses a peculiar acid taste.</p>
<p>Quails abundant, especially about this place, the water of the Helmund
is very clear and affords excellent fishing with worms which are greedily
taken, and also with the fly, particularly towards evening, by a species
of Gonorhynchus.</p>
<p><i>11th</i>.&mdash;Returned to the foot of the ascent of the Oonnoo,
nine miles: nothing new having been met with, except that Kohi-Baba
is seen to great advantage, from the higher ridges of this pass.&nbsp;
On going to Bamean we saw it for the first time from the ridges beyond
Yonutt, badly from the first, but beautifully from the second ridge.&nbsp;
The weather continues as usual threatening in the evening, clearing
up after sunset: there is less snow on Kohi-Baba now than when we went.</p>
<p><i>12th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Sir-i-Chushme, eight miles, which
was one continued descent.&nbsp; Passed Killa Moostaffur Khan, built
by a Kuzzilbash; it is the prettiest fort in the country.&nbsp; The
common Carduacea disappears below 9,500 feet, Cnicus of Koti-Ashruf
commences here.</p>
<p>Temperature of the spring at Sir-i-Chushme, 55&deg; (1&frac12; P.M.);
that at Kallo, on the other side of Hajeeguk, 45&deg;.</p>
<p>All crops are cut, and the ground ploughed or preparing; in one place
the young wheat is springing up; but the country generally looks very
brown, and the hills small.&nbsp; Abundance of black teal.&nbsp; Plectranthus
reappears at the foot of Oonnoo, Verbascum rare, if any, on the Tartary
side of the Hindoo-koosh.&nbsp; Abundance of Loaches or Balitora in
the streamlets arising from the springs.</p>
<p>13th.&mdash;Proceeded to Julraiz, eight and a half miles, having
passed a waterfall, as well as abundance of people going to Jallalabad.&nbsp;
Bar. 22.760 at noon; Ther. 75&deg;.</p>
<p>14th.&mdash;Proceeded to Koti-Ashruf, where there is excellent fishing
with worms, the fish however did not take a fly, though they often appeared
at the surface: a large headed Silurus occurs, but I was unable to procure
a specimen.</p>
<p>15th.&mdash;Proceeded to Arghundee, where we met the Bamean force.</p>
<p>16th.&mdash;Proceeded to Topehee Bashee.</p>
<p>17th.&mdash;Returned to Cabul.&nbsp; Eryngium is rare between the
foot of Oonnoo and Moostaffur Khan&rsquo;s fort.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>
<p><i>From</i> <i>Cabul</i> <i>to</i> <i>Jallalabad</i> <i>and</i> <i>Peshawur</i>.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>7th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Bhootkhak, nine and
a half miles from Cabul, and seven from our camp: the direction lay
easterly.&nbsp; A canal and a river were both crossed by bridges, the
latter of stone, but much needing repairs: the country generally marshy:
the marshes were crossed by a causeway of stones, rough and broken here
and there.&nbsp; The road is one apparent continued slope to this, but
the Barometer gives no indication of any difference of level.&nbsp;
The march proving uninteresting, and the country an uniform brown and
barren tract.</p>
<p><i>8th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Koord Cabul valley, the distance of
which from the place we left being eleven miles: first having rounded
a spur extending from the south boundary of Cabul valley, we then entered
a narrow ravine, chiefly occupied by a small stream, which we crossed
several times.&nbsp; The mountains being chiefly of limestone, then
becoming slaty, very precipitous, rugged, and barren; on emerging from
this very tedious ravine, we entered on some sward with plenty of Tamarisk,
and Salix vimenea.&nbsp; Koord Cabul valley is a frightfully barren,
and very stony place; the chief vegetation of the valley, as also of
the ravine, being Artemisi&aelig;, in which there is abundance of Carduacea
subspicata from Baber&rsquo;s tomb.</p>
<p>The road throughout is indifferent, but only so from the stones,
the largest of which would require removal, and there are not more than
two or three difficult rocks in the way, these however might be avoided
by keeping in the bed of the stream.&nbsp; There are two ruined stone
walls thrown across the ravine, the remains merely of the very few villages
of Koord Cabul.&nbsp; A high truncated mountain stands to the south,
on which some patches of snow are visible.</p>
<p>The mountain forming the east wall of the ravine is the subconical
one, seen to such advantage from Arghundee, it is of limestone, quite
precipitous, with a few large bushes of, I do not know what; none of
them being within reach,&mdash;Ilex, and <i>Cupressus</i>.</p>
<p><i>9th</i>.&mdash;To Tazeen, the road for seven miles extends over
somewhat undulated ground, generally good; but here and there stony,
with a gradual but almost imperceptible ascent, until the top of the
pass is reached; from this, the view of Tazeen valley, and the summit
of the Sofaid-Koh is good.</p>
<p>Thence the road extends over ascents and descents, three of which
have considerable, and stony inclinations, then it enters the ravine
drained by a small stream, and continues down it until we enter Tazeen
valley.</p>
<p>Two streams are passed in the ascent; the first, near the former
halting place, flowing, where it is crossed, between slaty cliffs of
no height; the second one, small, frozen, and not sufficient to supply
a large party: there is however a spring a short way below the summit,
although very small.&nbsp; Temperature 58&deg;.&nbsp; The rocks forming
the narrow ravine are very rough and slaty: limestones presenting the
usual characters.</p>
<p>This march has been said to present a very bad road, but it is not
the case, at least in comparison with many of the Affghan roads, distance
twelve and a half miles, the time it takes for camels to perform the
journey is six hours.&nbsp; The road, where not stony, is very well
beaten.</p>
<p>No change is observed in the features of the country until the opposite
side of Tazeen valley is seen, and the summit of the Sofaid-Koh: here,
wonderful to relate! are abundance of firs extending down and along
the ridge to some distance, but not forming forests.</p>
<p>Otherwise the vegetation consists of Senecionoides, <i>Astragali</i>,
<i>Rosa</i>, Statice 2-3, Artemisi&aelig;, and Plectranthus, which last
is very common in the ravine leading to Tazeen valley, which is drained
by a small stream.&nbsp; Here also Carduacea, and Onosmoid angustifolia
occur!</p>
<p>In this ravine, Xanthoxylon of Kojhuk, a willow, Rosa, and a distinct
Ilex, occur, forming chiefly a shrubby vegetation.&nbsp; Ilex is also,
so far as can be judged from appearance, the bushy thing seen on the
limestone hill at our last halt, also Cupressus, a fine specimen of
which I found on limestone at about the height of the top of the pass,
(22.76 Bar.) Ther. 60&deg;, with a very small Spir&aelig;a.</p>
<p>The large-winged vultures of Arghundee are common here.&nbsp; Some
ruined villages were passed, a mosque stood near one of these, two and
a half miles from last halt, little cultivation in the Tazeen valley,
and in the centre of this, two villages with orchards are visible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Pass between Koord Cabul and Tazeen" src="images/m411.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>9th</i>.&mdash;Tried to get to the firs, but failed.</p>
<p>The lower hills, and indeed the range between the valley and the
fir range, are conglomerate, easily disintegrated, then limestone, which
often occurs quite vertical.&nbsp; Some of the hills are red, others
brown, in one instance the coloured substance is interposed between
strata of limestone, which last have alone withstood the effects of
climate, this range is as high as the Koord Cabul pass.</p>
<p>Ilex very common, and much used for charcoal, the trunk being eight
to ten inches in diameter; almost all are pollarded.&nbsp; Pomacea common
at 500 feet above this, Plectranthus, Senecionoides.</p>
<p>Artemisi&aelig;, Astragali, Statices, Rosa, bastard indigo, Cerasus.&nbsp;
The orchards are now assuming their autumnal tint, Salvia pinnata, Canus
aliusque, <i>Ruwash</i>.&nbsp; Chough, ravens, nuthatch, and chakor
here occur.&nbsp; Heavy snow is observed on the eastern portions of
Hindoo-koosh, which are quite barren.&nbsp; The best way to the fir
tract I find on enquiry will be to follow the bed of the stream up to
it.&nbsp; Fields are being now ploughed and sown.&nbsp; Thermopsides
very common here in old cultivation: it affords decent fodder for camels.</p>
<p><i>10th</i>.&mdash;To Barikab, distance ten and a half miles; the
road extending down the Tazeen ravine, over a tract with a considerable
descent for about nine miles; on passing a long dark looking rock and
its spur, the road then leaves the bed, and ascends over low undulations
of easily detachable conglomerate, and sand; then a short but rather
steep ascent occurs for 200 feet, passing over an easily friable sandstone,
either existing as grains slightly adherent, or caked; thence the descent
passes over the preceding sort of conglomerate, to an abominably barren
ravine, drained by a very small stream.</p>
<p>The road only once leaves the bed of this ravine, but soon rejoins
it before finally turning off.</p>
<p>The mountains present the same features; where no outcrop of strata
occurs, they are rounded, brown, and very barren, with here and there
an Ilex; towards the end of the raviny part in one or two places, more
wood than usual occurs, forming scattered thickets.&nbsp; Fraxinus,
the older branches of which have much smaller leaves, Thymelia of Chiltera,
Cerasus canus, and alius, Senecionoides, Composit&aelig;, Artemisi&aelig;,
Polygonum frutescens, which last is not uncommon throughout.&nbsp; Equisetoides
becomes common towards the black rock.</p>
<p>Where the road turns off from the ravine, a <i>Khubar</i> or tope
occurs, shaded with two or three large Xanthoxyle&aelig; now in fruit,
called <i>Khinjuk</i>.</p>
<p>Snow visible from Barikab to the north, but generally in ravines.&nbsp;
The country continues abominably barren, we passed the entrance of the
Lutabund pass, near the black rock, but without seeing it: no difficulty
occurs on the road, except from the jolting of stones.&nbsp; There is
however no forage to be had at the halt, and but little fodder.&nbsp;
A sprinkling of holly-looking bushes are seen extending over the lower
ranges of Hindoo-koosh.</p>
<p><i>11th</i>.&mdash;Jugdulluck, ten and a half miles from our last
encampment; on leaving Barikab we commenced ascending, winding over
undulating ground for a short distance, until we reached the main ascent,
which is short, but moderately steep: thence we descended steeply for
perhaps 500 feet, hitherto the road extended over sand hills, with quantities
of stones.&nbsp; On reaching the foot of the steep descent, we then
descended gradually over a long stony inclined plane, then entered undulating
ground, descending from which the road took us over a small stream,
which we followed up, soon entering a gorge, up which we continued till
we reached Jugdulluck.&nbsp; This gorge is the finest and boldest we
have seen, the rocks forming precipitous cliffs 2,400 feet high, which
often hem in the road, and confine it to a breadth of a few feet, sufficient
merely for a gun to pass.</p>
<p>On emerging from this we reached the tope of Jugdulluck, now a grove
of mulberry trees, surrounded by the remains of a wall.</p>
<p>The country, until we entered the gorge, presented the same features
as before, being frightfully barren.&nbsp; Passed a spring of water
at the foot of the main descent where there is level ground sufficient
for a small party, afterwards we passed a smaller spring containing
less water, but situated in much better ground than Barikab.</p>
<p>The vegetation of undulated ground continues unchanged, very poor
and stunted; in ravines below the main descent, Stipa is very common;
in others, a large Andropogon occurs near the mouth of the gorge along
the bed of the river, also <i>Jhow</i> in patches, and one patch of
Donax.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the gorge is more varied; two small trees occur,
one the <i>Khinjuk</i>, and it is the commonest, the other a Terebinthacea;
Thymel&aelig;a of Chiltera is common, Ephedra, Ilex occurs but is less
common than on hills.</p>
<p>Along the water to which it gives exit, and which is abundant, the
usual Cyperace&aelig;, Junce&aelig;, Gnaphalium, Potentilla, and Epilobium
occur as at Cabul; the place is chiefly remarkable for two or three
Saccharoid grasses, Stipa common, Polypogon, Donax, Dracocephala of
Quettah and the Bolan pass, Spir&aelig;a, Typha, young Tamarisks.</p>
<p>Chakor, large vulture, ravens; a woodcock rose from a dripping rock,
covered with a tropical Andropogon in dense patches.&nbsp; Adiantum,
Rubus, Erythrea, Labiat&aelig; two, common; Salix.</p>
<p>The gorge appears to be a distinct formation of sandstone, slate,
and limestone: on the way to it, we continued over the sand and conglomerate
hill, which again recur at Jugdulluck, with plenty of Holly.</p>
<p>The Sofaid-Koh is visible from the main ridge: it is a ridge running
perhaps SW. to NE., tolerably covered with snow, as barren as any others:
a few fir trees are found in the direction of Tazeen: are these confined
to the sandstone formation? little grass, a few rice fields, bad forage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m414.jpg">
<img alt="Pass and gorge, Barikab to Jugdulluck" src="images/m414.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>12th</i>.&mdash;Halted at Jugdulluck.&nbsp; Small partridges are
common: observed a curious Certhioid creeper, whose flight is like that
of the Hoopoe; it is scandent over rocks.</p>
<p><i>13th</i>.&mdash;To Soorkhab, twelve and a half miles over a similar
country: region of Hollys continues; we first passed up a ravine, then
over undulating ground, until the summit of the pass is reached.&nbsp;
From this a fine view of Sofaid-Koh is obtained, the lower ranges in
some places being black with firs; thence a continued descent, varied
here and there by small ascents over undulating ground, we at length
came to a ravine filled with bulrushes: we followed this, leaving it
near the halting place, and winding over rocky ground and a bad road,
we descended to the bed of the river.&nbsp; The road good, though stony
here and there, but nowhere so, to such an extent, as the previous marches.</p>
<p>Hills precisely similar to those already passed, either sandy, easily
friable, or conglomerate, held together by sandy cement.&nbsp; Vegetation
continues the same; <i>Baloot</i>, or oak, is said to be abundant though
I did not see it; Daphne, and Xanthoxylon, compose the chief shrubby
vegetation; Saccharum here and there.&nbsp; Small partridge very common.&nbsp;
The greatest ascent is 5,600 feet.&nbsp; No grass for forage; several
very small streamlets were passed en route, so that a small party might
halt anywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m415.jpg">
<img alt="Ascent and descent Jugdulluck to Soorkhab" src="images/m415.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The beautiful Himalaya looking range Sofaid-Koh, runs east and west;
it is very high, in the back ranges with very heavy snow on both ridges,
and peaks.&nbsp; The view from the pass shows a rapid fall in the country
to the eastward, which still continues hilly, and very very bare.&nbsp;
Large coarse grapes are had here, also pomegranates: some <i>seedless</i>
rice cultivation occurs since we descended to Jugdulluck.</p>
<p><i>14th</i>.&mdash;We proceeded nine and a quarter miles, throughout
until reaching a grove near Gundamuck: the road lay over undulating
ground, is more sandy than stony, and in two or three places it is raviny,
and requires to be made.&nbsp; Then the road emerges into a fine sort
of valley, dipping down to a small stream with many sedges.&nbsp; In
the bed of the stream, willows occur, and mulberries about it: we then
ascended and halted just beyond the ascent.&nbsp; Water and <i>dhoob</i>
grass are both plentiful, as well as supplies of grain, pomegranates,
and grapes, as yesterday; <i>Bajree</i>.</p>
<p>A fine view is obtained of Sofaid-Koh, which forms the southern boundary
of the valley; many villages, with cultivation in a very sandy soil.&nbsp;
Small partridge very abundant.&nbsp; A fox observed.&nbsp; The ravines
wherever there is water, crowded with Typha, and Saccharum; oaks are
seen in abundance on the mountain to the south; left the Soorkhab river
after fording it near yesterday&rsquo;s camp; the bridge is quite useless
for cattle, as the ground is rocky and broken on this side, no pains
having been taken to carry the work to the road; cypresses, planes and
mulberry trees in the gardens: Cannabis, also one patch of cotton cultivation
was passed.</p>
<p>No descent, but rather small ascent on the whole, say 200 feet, the
ascent from the principal nullah crossed being equal, though much shorter
than the descent to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m416.jpg">
<img alt="Soorkhab to Gundamuck" src="images/m416.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>15th</i>.&mdash;We halted: many rivulets descend near us from
the Sofaid-Koh; and the water in these is beautifully clear; many villages
and mills with several beautiful spots occur, well shaded with trees,
poplars, mulberries, and figs.&nbsp; The objects of cultivation are
millet, Indian-corn, rice, and wheat; this last just sprung up: many
<i>bedanah</i> pomegranates, but none I think of superior quality.</p>
<p>All the low hills here, and indeed between us and the boundary ranges
of the valley, are of sandstone, generally very slightly held together,
here and there more firm, and distinctly stratified towards the upper
surface.&nbsp; The surface consists of conglomerate, formed of boulders
imbedded in the same kind of sandstone as that below; often very friable,
occasionally it is as hard as flint.&nbsp; In the sandstone below, a
few stones occur here and there; but I saw no fossils.&nbsp; The upper
surface of these hills is remarkably stony, all the stones being more
or less rounded.</p>
<p>Several new plants were found in these ravines, a Lythrum, a very
aromatic species of Composit&aelig;, Samolus in some of the swamps with
Typha, which swarms in every ravine and ravinelet, Rubus, Clematis,
Bergia, Ammannia, Lythraria, Chara, Xanthium.</p>
<p>The plants of tropical forms are, Celosia of Digera! Polanisia, Andropogons,
two or three.</p>
<p>The tropical cultivation consists of cotton, the usual annual sort;
Indian-corn, Pennisetum, and rice.</p>
<p>The fish are, four kinds of Cyprinid&aelig;, including one Oreinus,
and one loach.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Futtehabad, eleven and a half miles.&nbsp;
The road leaves the valley after crossing a stream with a ruined bridge,
like that at Soorkhab, but of two arches, and ascending a little way,
then winding along over undulating very stony ground; this continues
until we descend steeply and along the Neemla valley, a mere ravine,
historically interesting, as the field on which Shah Soojah lost his
kingdom in 1809, and for a fine tope of trees: then crossing a streamlet,
we ascend a little way over sandstone, then another stream, which we
follow for 500 yards, and ascending a little, we proceed thence to camp,
along a slight slope of very stony, generally <i>very</i> <i>level</i>
ground, where we halted on a rivulet with a wide grassy bed, Lythrum
growing around.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m417.jpg">
<img alt="Gundamuck to Futtehabad" src="images/m417.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>No change appears in the vegetation: the surface very barren in stony
parts, chiefly Artemisia, Saccharum, Andropogon albus, in ravines, Capparis
common, also &AElig;rua and Lycionoides.</p>
<p>The northern boundary of the valley is comparatively low, and from
Sofaid-Koh to this is an uniform slope, broken by ravines; here and
there by small hills; ravines occasionally dilating into small valleys,
the only parts in which cultivation is to be seen.&nbsp; This is so
far different from the usual formation where the valleys occupy the
level tract between the slopes from either boundary range.&nbsp; Neemla
is a very confined space for any thing like the battle said to have
taken place here, the rising grounds inclosing the small space being
too much broken for cavalry.</p>
<p>The rocks consist of conglomerate at top, below sandstone, layers
of both alternating near the surface: a break occurs (nearly opposite)
in the hills, this break is minutely undulated. <a name="citation417"></a><a href="#footnote417">{417}</a>&nbsp;
Rock pigeons were seen on the march by Thomson, and small partridges.&nbsp;
I find that though to our senses there was comparatively but little
descent, that the barometer and thermometer indicate one of 1,500 feet.&nbsp;
The Neemla river must be the boundary between the hot and cold countries
alluded to by Burnes.</p>
<p>In spite of this descent, and our small altitude, about 3,000 feet,
but little change if any occurs in the vegetation, and none in the general
features of the country; the Apocynea of Dadur and Bolai (Nerioides)
has re-appeared.</p>
<p>At this season (October), throughout the way we came from Cabul,
there is a curious white efflorescence covering the Shootur Kari, I
do not know what it is, but it is not Conferva.&nbsp; A good deal of
forest is seen on some of the ranges to the north of this, bearing from
camp about NNE., certainly not firs, perhaps oaks.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday we went to the Soorkhab, which runs
east and west along the northern boundary of the valley; half the distance
down the bed of this stream the ground is strewed with boulders, thence
to the hills, and excepting the bed of the Soorkhab, is one sheet of
cultivation, consisting of large quantities of cotton and sugar-cane,
this latter of small size, and not very juicy, castor-oil plant, Corchorus
(<i>Pat</i>), <i>Sun</i>, Tel., radish, and among the other plants cultivated,
the Mudar is common: Nerioides of Dadur; Epilobium sp. is the chief
Boreal form.&nbsp; This is one of the richest districts I have seen.</p>
<p>Trees&mdash;Bukkhien, <a name="citation418"></a><a href="#footnote418">{418}</a>
<i>Furas</i>, Ficus, Cupressus, with much rice cultivation.</p>
<p>The vines are trained on mulberries, as Burnes says, or the Lilyoak.&nbsp;
Pomegranates are also to be mentioned among the fruits of this place.</p>
<p>The Soorkhab river is not seen after leaving the place of the same
name; after it crosses the road, it runs due north through the mountains,
in a narrow, almost inaccessible bed; its waters are of a reddish colour.</p>
<p>The villages here are larger, and not so fortified as those about
Cabul.&nbsp; Balabagh stands on a high bank of conglomerate, overhanging
the Soorkhab, and is in danger of being cut away by the river.&nbsp;
The peasantry are civil, and unarmed.&nbsp; Ravens, quails, <i>minas</i>,
sparrows, and a beautiful swallow were seen about the Soorkhab river;
the latter, with metallic blue on the back of the head, crown of head
tawny, tail short, two exterior feathers elongated into beautiful almost
setaceous bodies, exceeding the length of the bird.&nbsp; This swallow,
or one with a similar tail, was seen by Sanders on the Helmund, at Girishk.</p>
<p><i>20th</i>.&mdash;We proceeded to Sultanpore, eight and a half miles,
passed Futtehabad, thence a gradual descent over a very stony slope
to the halting place, where the valley becomes narrow, and water plentiful
in a small stream.&nbsp; Willows, mulberries, ashes.&nbsp; Two large
pollards at Futtehabad.</p>
<p>The vegetation consists of Gramine&aelig; in patches, &AElig;rua
Nerioides, and Mudar.</p>
<p>Sultanpore, is a village of some size, situated about a mile north
from the road, and contains many Hindoos.&nbsp; All villages here crowded
with highish two or three-storied houses, something like Shikarpore:
they are surrounded with gardens and mud walls, apricots, mulberries,
greengages, pomegranates in profusion; the cultivation very rich as
yesterday, and there is an air of repose about the villages unusual
in this country.&nbsp; Tobacco.&nbsp; The rice-pounder or <i>dekhee</i>
I observe is here lifted by treading on it with the foot, as in Hindoostan.&nbsp;
The country hereabout, has the advantage of being well watered.&nbsp;
<i>Isain</i>, Dolichos sp. occurs.</p>
<p>Trees as before: the plane flourishes, fine ones were seen growing
around a Hindoo Zearut, where there is a double spring of water with
a copious ebullition of gas.&nbsp; The temperature of this is said to
be hot in winter.&nbsp; Salsola common, <i>Joussa</i>, a curious Ericoid
plant was observed, Typha angustifolia, latifolia ceased since we left
Gundamuck; Isachne, Pulicaria, Epilobium, Sagittaria, Cyperace&aelig;,
Marsilea! Polygonum, Ranunculus sceleratus, Lythrum, Lemna, Alisma,
Menthoid, a Cuscuta common on cotton plants, as at Futtehabad, several
tropical grasses, Aristida, Poa, and Andropogon appear.</p>
<p>Descent though almost unappreciable, yet amounts to 1,000 feet.&nbsp;
Bulbul and Parus common, as well as doves and ravens; quails are scarce.</p>
<p><i>21st</i>.&mdash;To Jallalabad, eight and a half miles, the road
keeping along the southern edge of the valley, occasionally extending
over small undulations sometimes stony, more often sandy.</p>
<p>Typha latifolia occurs in profusion along parts of Futtehabad nullah,
general features the same otherwise, &AElig;rua and Nerioid are common
on stony parts, and fewer coarse grasses.</p>
<p>Cypresses in gardens, also <i>khujoors</i>.&nbsp; Starlings.</p>
<p>The entrance to Jallalabad, or rather to its suburbs, presents the
usual desolate, disorderly appearance, of such places in this country;
the ruined walls to the city; the sandy barren soil, and the odious
looking low hills between it and the Sofaid-Koh, present as sad and
melancholy a picture as could well be met with.&nbsp; The same desolate,
disorderly, dirty appearance is to be met with in most Asiatic capitals,
particularly those that have been subjected to independent misrule:
while the more distant surrounding villages look cheerful, and as clean
as can be expected: the appearances immediately around the chief towns
are always bad.&nbsp; To what is this owing? is it to their being more
completely under the thumb of a rapacious governor? to the insecurity
of property, or to defect in the laws? or to all these causes together?</p>
<p>At Cabul it was just the same, particularly on the Peshawur side,
where stagnant pools, half destroyed mosques, and mutilated trees present
a total contrast to the smiling valley of Kilah-i-Kajee.</p>
<p>At Shikarpore the same.</p>
<p>The most common fruit tree in the gardens here is a sweet lime: grapes
are brought in from the villages of Sofaid-Koh, they are the same sort
as those at Gundamuck: Narcissus, Rosa, Cerasi sp., Mirabilis, stock,
Cupressus, mulberry also in gardens, <i>Bheir</i> of waste places, Salsola,
Artemisi&aelig;, two or three: Kochia villosa, Peganum, &AElig;rua,
Croton of Candahar, Ricinus, <i>Joussa</i> of wet places, Lippia, Typha
latifolia, angustif., Azolla, Riccia, Cyperace&aelig;, several Lythrarie&aelig;,
Potamogeton, three species.&nbsp; The fish here will not take a fly,
and the bottoms are too foul and stony for worm-fishing, the largest
sort of fish is somewhat like a Barbel.&nbsp; Jackdaws and Corvus, alter
atratus, dorso ventre griseo: very few quails.&nbsp; <i>Furas</i> common.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;To Ali-Baghan, distance six and a half miles,
road winding, generally good: after it crossed the dry bed of the nullah,
it then becomes rather undulated extending over raviny ground; it then
crosses the broad bed of the stream, in which there are swarms of bulrushes,
then the same sort of sandy ground leads to camp, which is near the
village Ali-Baghan.</p>
<p>The river here is much increased, much more deep; banks alluvial,
steep; soil deep.&nbsp; Chenopodium sp., very common, but too much eaten
up to be recognized, also Salsol&aelig; sp.</p>
<p>Nothing new observed.&nbsp; We passed the break above-mentioned in
the northern hills, whence issues the Coomur Nuddee.&nbsp; Serratuloides
very common in sandy undulations.&nbsp; Porcupines and foxes.&nbsp;
Beds of grass in islands of the river Barikab.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;We proceeded to Bankok, twelve and a half miles
from the encamping ground, having turned nearly due south, in order
to avoid the slope, which is seen in this direction from Jallalabad;
then a valley, with low hills on either side, is passed; then the road
ascends over undulating ground, until 500 feet is gained; then a long
and gradual descent is traversed over a very stony plateau.</p>
<p>No water nor cultivation on the road, nothing can exceed its barrenness.&nbsp;
&AElig;rua Nerioides, Lycioides, Andropogon albus, are the principal
plants on the plateau; Kochia common, and a few straggling <i>Bheirs</i>,
small rock pigeons.&nbsp; Geology unchanged, sandstone and conglomerate,
with enormous boulders.</p>
<p>We passed the gorge through which the Cabul river runs.&nbsp; The
road, by this is said to be only six miles, but is only passable by
pedestrians and horsemen.</p>
<p>One village of some size is situated in the south towards Sofaid-Koh;
from the plateau as well as from our camp, a curious and characteristic
scene is visible to the north, showing a barren lofty range with peculiar
undulations at the base, as well as the isolated hills jutting up above
its surface: the trees and villages being confined to the course of
the river which may be thus traced by its fertility.&nbsp; In this last
direction there is a good deal of <i>Abadi</i>, but nothing comparable
to that about Jallalabad.</p>
<p>At camp Serratuloid australasicus, very common, as indeed it was
yesterday; <i>foliis</i> <i>verticalibus</i> in consequence of both
surfaces being stomatose, the base of the leaf is so twisted as to present
each surface equally to the light.&nbsp; It is curious that all such
leaves have the veins prominent on both surfaces, showing a relation
between the veins and the stomata, the more stomata the larger veins.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;To Bassoollah, eight and a half miles, the road
for guns is good throughout; better perhaps than any yet met with, from
the soil being sandy.&nbsp; We came by a straighter road, and a very
bad one, instead of diverging to the south, and rounding a range of
hills, we entered these, and passing through a gorge coming upon marshy
ground, running for some distance along the Cabul river, to which we
were here quite close.&nbsp; Passed several villages about the mouth
of the gorge, which is a short one.</p>
<p>The general features of the country continue the same; we crossed
a nullah near the camp, and another near the gorge, six miles from camp,
towards this last, grass covers the plains, though of a coarse kind;
&AElig;rua Nerioides most common on the barren ground.</p>
<p>We observed on the way a new Pterocles, and passed an old tope situated
on a low ridge.</p>
<p>The gorge is rather pretty; the Cabul river runs close, along the
foot of a range, forming the northern boundary of the place, where Bassoollah
is situated, this is also a pretty place, with much good grassy ground
for encamping on.</p>
<p>The country under Sofaid-Koh presents a long strip of cultivation,
with many villages: hills barrener than ever, chiefly limestone.&nbsp;
Very little snow here observed as on the eastern face of the high peaks
of Sofaid-Koh, compared with the quantity visible on the face towards
Jallalabad.</p>
<p>About half-past two, a slight shock of an earthquake was felt, presenting
a rumbling noise, very audible, proceeding from east to west.</p>
<p>Between the village and the river, an extensive strip of level land
occurs, with sandy soil well adapted to rice, of which quantities are
grown.&nbsp; The crops are now ready for the sickle, and some partly
cut: much of this land is occupied by a marsh choked with bulrushes
of both sorts, Typha latifolia being the most common; Cyperace&aelig;
abound, Marsilea in profusion, Azolla, Mentha, Epilobii sp. as before,
Lemna, Valisneria <i>verticillata</i>? Sium., Sagittaria, Pulicaria,
Chara, Lippia, Monniera, <i>Jhow</i>.</p>
<p>The river runs close under the hills, which are very barren, its
course is rapid, cataracts also are of frequent occurrence transmitting
a great body of water; no fish are visible.&nbsp; Some cotton and maize
and <i>Toot</i> cultivation.&nbsp; <i>Furas</i> the only trees.</p>
<p>The mountains slope off from Sofaid-Koh in distinct groups, and are
seen to advantage, broken in some places into undulations: about the
centre of the slope an irregular strip of village forts and cultivation
is extended.&nbsp; The course of the Cabul river in many places is curious;
flowing between singularly round ranges.&nbsp; Snipe common; quail rare.&nbsp;
Erythr&aelig;a common on moist sward.</p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Lalpore, the country undulating,
the road skirting the stony portions of the plain is bad to Hizarnow,
three miles from thence it is very stony, thence continuing on the skirts
of the hills, which are principally slate, and passing through a small
ravine, it then extends over sandy or stony ground, until the Chota
Khyber is reached: this is a narrow, but short, and not very steep pass;
slate rocks compose the upper parts, and are entirely disintegrated,
thence they descend at once into the plain opposite Lalpore; the distance
of the march is eleven miles, the road generally decent.</p>
<p>Much rice cultivation occurs, and much land, it must be confessed,
also occupied by marshy ground, Typha, etc. The same plants continue;
Butomus trigonifolius not uncommon.</p>
<p>On the slate rocks of Buttencote Kochia recurs, Heliotropium luteum,
Nerioides, and Lycioides of Shikarpore are found.</p>
<p>Near Hizarnow, Serissa, Acaci&aelig; sp., which is the black wood
of Madras; Sissoo, and <i>Bheirs</i>.&nbsp; Hizarnow is a large place,
curiously occupying receding slopes of the base of a low range of hills,
but it must be dreadfully hot.&nbsp; We passed several <i>Kaburistans</i>
with pollarded, stunted, excavated <i>Furas</i> trees.&nbsp; One mile
before Hizarnow, a curious hill of slate occurred, covered with boulders.</p>
<p>The road is very winding in consequence of its following the bases
of the hills forming the southern boundary of the valley.&nbsp; The
Cabul river is visible almost throughout the whole march.</p>
<p>All houses in the villages are now roofed in this part of the country
with straw.&nbsp; Starlings observed in swarms.</p>
<p><i>31st</i>.&mdash;Halted at Lalpore, this is a very busy large place:
the houses are one-storied, and flat-roofed.&nbsp; The only peculiarity
being occasional square towers.&nbsp; The river is here quite open for
commerce downwards, and is well adapted to small canoes: the stream
is rapid and crossed by a ferry.</p>
<p>On rocks under which the river flows near this, a species of Fissidens
occurs, where the rocky surface has passed into sand.&nbsp; Glycyrrhiza,
Rubus, Artemisia, Asparagus, Pommereulla, Andropogon albus, Arundo,
Cyrthandracea, an Hyoscyamus of the Bolan Pass, Beebee Nanee, Heliotropium
flavum.</p>
<p>It would be curious to enquire why the powers of variation change
so completely in the different families?&nbsp; Thus for instance in
Orchide&aelig;, no character can be taken from the vegetation with some
limitations, and none from the fruit or seeds; two products in most
orders very fruitful in discriminating marks.&nbsp; This leads one to
the idea that in monocotyledonous plants, the fruit is very generally
of limited powers of variation; witness Orchide&aelig;, Gramine&aelig;,
Smilacine&aelig;, etc. this idea deserves to be followed out as much
as possible.&nbsp; The river at the ferry is 100 yards wide, and twelve
feet in the deepest part, the current five miles an hour, but confined
to one and a half towards its centre.</p>
<p><i>November</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Marched ten miles: the road from
the camp extended up an acclivity, the ground becoming more broken than
usual to the mouth of the ghat, which is four miles distant; thence
up to the ghat which resembles much the Bolan Pass, it extends up an
inclined plane over a shingly road.&nbsp; The ghat is rather wide throughout,
and all the features are the same as the Bolan Pass, slate rocks most
common.&nbsp; We passed on the way a large and a deep but dry well,
ascribed to the <i>kafirs</i>; and near it the ruins of a fort built
half-way up a small mountain, the top of which is level with the ghat.</p>
<p>Vegetation to the ghat unchanged.&nbsp; In the ghat Capparis as before,
Lycioides, Cham&aelig;rops, Andropog. albus, Sch&aelig;nanthus, <i>Bheir</i>,
Nerioides, Pommereullioid, Andropogonea, appear at once, &AElig;rua,
Asparagus.</p>
<p>At 300 feet up, Mimos&aelig; sp., foliis tomentosis, occurring here
and there.&nbsp; Heliotropium flavum, Plectranthus lavandulosus, Scrophulari&aelig;
sp.</p>
<p>At 500 feet, Dodon&aelig;a: this is very common, and being very green,
gives the ghat a pretty appearance.</p>
<p>At 600 feet, a curious pomaceous looking Rhamnaceous plant is found.</p>
<p>The most common plants are Nerioides, Andropogon albus, <i>Bheir</i>,
Cham&aelig;rops, Dodon&aelig;a.</p>
<p>The bed of the ghat is formed of debris from the boundary hills,
this bed is very thick, and the particles have the appearance of being
carried to their present situation by water.</p>
<p>Our halting place is a confined irregular piece of ground, water
abundant, but no grass, except coarse Andropogon; no fodder, except
<i>Bheir</i> and Mimosa.</p>
<p>I ascended in the evening the ridge to the south, and which is 1,200
feet above the road, to the ruins that run along the summit.&nbsp; The
ridge, like all others in this neighbourhood, is rugged and much distorted,
the top is limestone, much varied and weathered; then slate masses of
greenstone occur towards the base.</p>
<p>The vegetation is chiefly at the summit.&nbsp; Sch&aelig;nanthus,
Periploca, Dodon&aelig;a, an arbuscula nova, Euonymus, Chenopodiace&aelig;.&nbsp;
Below this, (but the elevation is scarcely sufficient to form any difference,)
and along the water, Euonymus, Adhatoda, Buddl&aelig;a cana or Syringia,
Rhamnacea, Periplocea, Linaria, Labiat&aelig;, 2-3, Pistacea, Roylea,
Acanthoides, <i>Urticea</i>! habitu, U. penduliflor&aelig;, Vitex, Convolvulus
spinosus of Bolan, Sempervivum, Stapelioides used as a vegetable, and
for fever by Hindoos, Artemisi&aelig;, Solanum sp.</p>
<p>Along water, Adiantum, Mentha, Epilobium, Verbena officinalis, Solanum
nigrum, Jacquinifol. pinnatif. spinosus about cultivation.</p>
<p>On slaty rocks which form the bed of the ravine or ghat, Dodon&aelig;a,
Hyoscyamus, and Cyrthandracea are found.</p>
<p>The building consists of a wall near the edge of a ridge, which terminates
some twenty feet from the steep precipice of 300 to 500 feet: it is
200 to 300 yards in length, and is terminated at either end by two towers,
both of which are ruinous, it is built of slabs and rough blocks of
limestone, between which are layers of slate, much like the Bactrian
pillar, and very superior to modern buildings: what its use was, it
would be difficult to conjecture as it is out of musket shot of the
ghat, which it only commands by being above it.&nbsp; There is no water
on the top, nor is there any well-marked path up to it: curious mortar-like
excavations were observed in a mass of limestone just below, probably
for pounding rice.&nbsp; Up the ravine are remains of terraces formerly
used for cultivation, but now mostly disused.&nbsp; At 700 to 800 feet
above the ghat the ravine abounds with the Ficus of Gundamuck; this
and the Adhatoda or <i>Rooss</i> are perhaps cultivated: the ravine
is pretty well entangled with Ficus and brushwood.&nbsp; It consists
of metamorphosed rocks and excavated limestone; some mosses occur, and
Adiantum abounding.</p>
<p>From the ridge, a rather extensive view to the south is obtained,
extending to the Khyber fort, which is of the ordinary square form,
and just below it, a tower and house.&nbsp; To the east, and all around
a good deal of cultivation occurs; also several high ridges, say 7,000
feet; one terminating 4,000 feet above us, presents a very rugged outline
with the appearance of rather large trees.&nbsp; The road up to the
ghat is visible, as well as the <i>Choky</i> and a fort, with a small
sheet of cultivation to the eastward.&nbsp; Beyond this a ravine, then
two other ridges, of which the nearer one is high.&nbsp; The Cabul river
passes to the NNW., and Lalpoor lies to the north.&nbsp; One peak and
a small piece of ridge of Hindoo-koosh, white with snow, is seen very
distinctly though distant, it must therefore be very lofty; far more
so than any part we have seen to the westward.</p>

<p><i>Description</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>annexed</i> <i>map</i>
<i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Khyber</i> <i>Pass</i>.</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Kumdhukta.&nbsp; By this is Abkhanah route.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; Little Khyber ghat, on Peshawur side.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; Khyber ghat, entrance on the Jallalabad side.</p>
<p>D.&nbsp; Kurraha route.</p>
<p>E.&nbsp; Direction of Sofaid-Koh in the distance.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; Flagstaff in the middle of the Pass.</p>
<p>The ground between the dotted lines and river, on the south, is,
or has been cultivated.&nbsp; The ground near the river on the north
side is covered here and there with brown grass.&nbsp; About the Flagstaff,
sand and short dried up grass occur.</p>
<p>The general character of the hills in every direction except the
snowy range, is bluffly rounded, very bare, and brown, with here and
there a shrub.</p>
<p>That which Burnes calls Noorgil, is the range of Kareaz, and is distinct
from Koonur.&nbsp; Kashgur lies beyond the snowy range.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the mountains, like those of Lalpoor, wear sandals
made of the fibres of Cham&aelig;rops, which is common: one plant of
Ephedra used <i>for</i> <i>snuff</i>?</p>
<p><i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to one mile beyond Ali-Musjid.&nbsp;
The ascent commences immediately where the <i>Choky</i> is seen from
the camp, by a very good road cut out of slate rock; the rocks are steep
on both sides, and very zig-zag; a short partial descent in one place
occurs to a small pool of water.&nbsp; From the <i>Choky</i>, a descent
takes place by a similar road for perhaps two miles, until the ravine
which we left at camp is turned; this is thence followed, occasionally
leaving it where the road is bad and runs through low rugged hills.&nbsp;
The road then after passing some of the old ruins opens out into a space
with cultivation.&nbsp; Close to this is the highest spot of the pass,
surrounded by low hills, none higher than 500 feet.&nbsp; Cultivation
occurs especially at Lal-Ghurry Beg, a space of some size, containing
several villages, of the usual Khyberry form, namely, surrounded by
low, quadrangular walls, with a thin square tower and very broadly projecting
eaves.&nbsp; A short distance from its summit, just after passing the
villages, and before entering the ravine which leads us to our present
camp is a Khyberry tower, built on a fine Bactrian tope, which is nearly
half ruined; on the top of this a dome of good proportions is built
on a double-terraced foundation.</p>
<p>This gives a rude idea of what the tope was originally, now half
the dome has fallen down.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m426.jpg">
<img alt="A Khyberry tower" src="images/m426.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The entrance to the ravine gradually becomes narrower, the bed is
stony, very winding, and narrow.&nbsp; Bold precipices of limestone
cliffs ascend on either side of Sir-i-Chushme; then a little below,
very copious springs issue from limestone.&nbsp; The temperature of
the principal spring is 75&deg;; it contains abundance of fish&mdash;a
loach and cyprinoid.&nbsp; Passed some ruined fortifications on the
right, leading down to water, evidently <i>kafir</i> works; then we
enter a narrow but short gorge, occupied by the stream; a few more turns
and you come on Ali-Musjid.&nbsp; No change occurs in the vegetation,
bare rocks at the summit of which the Bar. stood at 26.72.&nbsp; Andropogons
and Artemisi&aelig; are the chief plants.</p>
<p>In the gorge downwards, Acacia occurs in abundance, with Adhatoda,
and otherwise the shrubs of Lundyakhana occur in abundance, and Adiantum
about the spring.</p>
<p>After passing the fort, the rocks open out into a ravine, with low
undulated hills on every side, covered with the usual vegetation; Astragalus
one species.</p>
<p>At Lal-Ghurry Beg, one Khinjuck tree, El&aelig;agnus, occurred; and
grass in very small stacks, well pressed and covered with a thatch of
bushes and a layer of dirt.</p>
<p>There is excellent fishing in the stream.&nbsp; Loaches, Perilamps,
and especially an Oreinus? swarming at Sir-i-Chushme, and taking worms
very greedily.</p>
<p>No forests whatever visible in this direction; the arborescent vegetation
being confined to scattered and small trees.</p>
<p><i>5th</i>.&mdash;We halted near Jumrood, after a march of ten miles
and one furlong.&nbsp; This place is situated at the mouth of the pass,
within sight of the Seikh camp at Jumrood.&nbsp; Marched down to the
ghat, which is generally speaking narrow and very strong, opening out
here and there, into easier parts extending down the stream all the
way; this stream loses itself suddenly, but after a little distance
it is replaced by another from the right, where ravines enter: here
the pass is well adapted for pillage, elsewhere the sides are so steep,
that robbers could not dispose of their plunder.&nbsp; At the mouth,
the pass opens out into a good breadth, with an even, small, shingly
bottom.&nbsp; At Kuddun the Seikh troops were drawn up to compliment
the C. in C., one regiment met us shortly before to protect the baggage.&nbsp;
Maize cultivated.&nbsp; At the mouth, the Khyber is more difficult than
any other pass, except the Bolan: perhaps it is much narrower than that,
except just above Sir-i-Bolan.</p>
<p>No change in vegetation, one or two new plants occurred, viz. a Labiata,
and a treelet, foliis linearibus oppositis, Jasminacea aspectu, Baloot,
Vitex common, Salix, and shrubs as before, Veronica, etc.</p>
<p>The Khyber mountains viewed from the mouth of the pass are brown,
and dotted with peculiar looking trees.</p>
<p><i>6th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded six and a half miles to near the ruins
of an old tope; first, down the nullah, then by the fort of Futtygurh,
a Hindoostanee mud fort with high parapets, two lines of works, and
a <i>pucka</i> citadel with embrasures for guns on a commanding mound:
thence we passed over a gentle slope with a good many scattered <i>Bheirs</i>,
<i>Kureels</i>, &AElig;rua, Mudar, etc. to camp, where the ground is
very rough and stony, abundant water obtained from a cut with sheets
of maize cultivation.&nbsp; Fossil shells, Pterocles, found in arenaceous
limestone (Durand).</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;To Peshawur, eight and a half miles, over a sandy
plain; road bad, intersected with cuts and ravines; three canals had
to be crossed by small bridges which occasioned a good deal of delay
to the camels.&nbsp; Passed the Seikh lines, between the fort and north
face of town, and encamped on east face opposite the Governor&rsquo;s
house: three gibbets were passed, with twelve persons hanging from them,
some of old date.</p>
<p>In the evening we had a gay party at M. Avitabili&rsquo;s, who is
a fine looking man, with an intelligent Italian countenance.</p>
<p>In a room gaudily decorated and painted, was the following very appropriate
motto&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tempora si fuerunt nubila, solus eris.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this was true in Rome, and is true in Europe, to what extent does
its truth not reach in this country.&nbsp; In the evening we were entertained
with dancing and fireworks; excellent dinner and admirable bread.</p>
<p><i>14th</i>.&mdash;To-day the atmosphere is hazy, but the snowy range
is not topped with clouds.&nbsp; It is curious enough that the part
which is most exposed to our view, and which bears about north-east,
is generally clouded throughout the hotter parts of the day, while apparently
equally high peaks in other directions remain clear.</p>
<p>It is curious that in Khorassan remarkably few climbing plants occur,
and of these, the chief form is Cuscuta.</p>
<p>Botany here at this season is a non-entity, in the marsh close to
the fort, there occur some few plants, the chief European forms being
Veronica.&nbsp; Ranunculus sceleratus is now coming into flower, Typha
angustifolia abounds, with Arundo, also Sparganium, Sium, Butomus trigonifolius
common; otherwise Cyperace&aelig;, <i>Epilobium</i> <i>out</i> <i>of</i>
<i>season</i>! Ranunculus aquaticus is most abundant; two species of
Chara, or rather 1 Chara, and 1 Nitella, the last a beautiful species,
Marsilea in profusion, Azolla common, Lemna two or three species, one
<i>new</i>, a floating Marchantiacia, Nelumbium occurs, but only as
a cultivated plant.</p>
<p>Of two Boreal, or European forms found in sub-tropical countries,
that form is the most northern which flowers, etc. in the coldest season,
hence Veronica and Ranunculus are more northern than <i>Epilobium</i>
in this particular district.&nbsp; The most elevational plant at Cabul
is Cardaminoidea, floribus luteis, this flowers at high altitudes in
August and September, and at Cabul shows no symptom of flowering even
in October; it is there a winter plant?&nbsp; The same is true of Hippuris,
which to flower at Cabul requires a greater degree of cold than is obtainable
during the summer months.</p>
<p>What I have said of Epilobium above, is true of Typha and Arundo,
both now passed flowering, and both found in India, to a considerable
extent.</p>
<p>Royle&rsquo;s idea of the comparatively greater extent of distribution
of water plants is not I think correct, in the sense he seems to entertain
it; to be so, the species should be the same, which they are certainly
not.&nbsp; It is only with pre-eminently aquatic forms that the annual
temperature can be more equalised than obtains with strictly terrestrial
plants.&nbsp; The humidity which may appear connected with the rapid
evaporation in these countries, and which obtains? in the vicinity of
all bodies of water, may account for the appearance here of Arundo,
etc.&nbsp; All genuine aquatic types have leaves involute in vernation?</p>
<p>The least valuable of all northern forms, are those associated with
cultivation, especially if they be annuals, because in the first place
they may be acclimated species, a circumstance of great importance;
and in the second, because if annual, they are confined to the cold
season.&nbsp; All such forms have probably migrated into these countries,
they have come from the westward: this shows us why at almost equal
elevations they are most common, the nearer we approach to the elevated
regions towards the west, because it is self-evident that the nearer
we approach the regions whence they have migrated, the more abundant
and diversified will the migrating plants be, only particular species
having the power of extending the range of migration.</p>
<p>When all the Indian plants hitherto met with, have been tabulated;
when all their respective heights at which they have been found have
been determined; when their more strictly geographical sites have been
fixed; when we have some data as to the quantity of humidity pervading
their localities; then, and not till then, shall we be able to legislate
for the geography of Indian botany.</p>
<p>The Botanist who travels without the means of determining these points,
destroys half the value of his collections.</p>
<p><i>December</i> <i>16th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday was very raw and cloudy,
to-day clear as usual, towards 1 P.M. a strong north-east wind occurred
for a short time as usual, because once or twice before, it occurred
after threatening weather.</p>
<p><i>Rationale</i>.&mdash;It blows from the nearest snow to supply
the rarefied air in the valley heated by the sun, even now tolerably
powerful; it blows for some days so long as a vacuum is formed, and
discontinues when clouds again appear; hardly so, as it before only
blew for three or four days, although several more elapsed before clouds
re-appeared: it may however be dependent on each fresh fall of snow
in the hills.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;Cloudy morning, forenoon fine, clear and calm.</p>
<p>Mosses are the analogues of Zoophytes; these analogies are to be
looked for in the most striking and most constant parts of the organization
of the divisions of nature.</p>
<p>Marchantiace&aelig; are the representatives of radiate animals, another
reason why Jungermanniace&aelig; are to be separated from them.</p>
<pre>Hence, Radiata,  = Marchantiace&aelig;.
  &ldquo;    Zoophyta, = Musci.</pre>
<p>I am quite convinced that the true subordinate groups of Acotyledones
are far from being discovered.</p>
<p>Are the sheaths found on certain radicles strictly confined to monocotyledonous
plants.&nbsp; There is this certain about them, that they depend on
the presence of vascular tissue, from which the radicles or the divisions
of each root originate: see young Hyacinth roots, grown in water.</p>
<p>Although the sheaths cannot exist without a positive cuticle, their
existence does not depend so much on its presence as on the direction
of the adhesive powers of its component parts: witness certain forms
of Marchantiace&aelig;, and the vaginate forms, as Azolla, Lemna, etc.&nbsp;
Also the sheath may not have adhesive powers at its apex to prevent
the escape of the radical at that point: witness Hyacinth roots?&nbsp;
We may imagine a case in which the primary radicle may be without a
sheath, while its divisions shall have them, this depending on the want
of adhesion of the cuticle over the original one.</p>
<p>The emerged and immersed leaves of plants are well worthy of examination,
since Microphytum proves that stomata do not depend on the presence
of a cuticle as Brongniart supposes: their presence is united with,
or allied to an amount of density in the cellular tissue, sufficient
to prevent the due aeration of the inner cellules, without direct communication
with the atmosphere.&nbsp; Vide Musci!!&nbsp; Hence the inner tubes
of the leaves of the generality of aquatic plants, (exception Eriocaulon
fluitans.)</p>
<p>What is the cause of the plurality of radicles in certain species
of Lemna, and their blank in others?&nbsp; It will be necessary on this
point to examine well the sheaths of Azolla, and to look at the Mergui
&AElig;schynanthus.</p>
<p>The formation of Affghanistan is very curious: it consists of a wide
extent of country, variously elevated steppes being separated by ridges
usually very accessible, generally isolated.&nbsp; The mountainous part
varies as to its formation, but there is no variety in the declivities
and acclivities forming the lower elevations, which are composed of
conglomerate; nor is there much in the usually narrow strip at the lowest
portion of each steppe or valley, which is very generally the only cultivatable
portion.</p>
<p>In the Khyber ghat the ridges are either of limestone or slaty rocks,
between which conglomerate occurs of various thicknesses; this being
dependent on the angle of the mountains forming the sides of the ghat:
it is from this conglomerate in such places consisting usually of a
loose texture that the very excellent roads (for mountainous passes)
are naturally made by the draining streams, which are only periodical.&nbsp;
The conglomerate consists of water-worn stones of all sizes, even boulders
are not unfrequent, yet the wearing is such as occurs in courses now
filling the beds of torrents.&nbsp; The conglomerate increases in density
and adhesion towards Lalpoor, and in many places is exceedingly hard.</p>
<p>Whatever the country may have been previously, one might explain
its present appearance by supposing it to have consisted of a tolerably
level extent of conglomerate, with here and there a strip of soil in
the lowest part of each portion, and that the elevation of the mountain
ridges was of subsequent occurrence: this would account for the formation
of the lower slopes, and the frequent isolation of small eminences of
the same character as the neighbouring mountains.&nbsp; It will account
for the appearance of the conglomerate in every ravine until the top
of the culminating point is reached.</p>
<p>As the mountains were elevated, portions of conglomerate would be
detached, and these resting again on all suitable places, would account
for the existence of conglomerate on certain parts which are flatter
than usual.</p>
<p>Whirlwinds are common about Cabul, commencing as soon as the sun
has attained a certain degree of power.</p>
<p>In all cases they assume the shape of a cone, the point of which
being a tangent on the earth&rsquo;s surface: the cone varies in shape,
is generally of a good diameter, occasionally much pulled out, some
being 2,300 feet in height, the currents are most violent at the apex.</p>
<p>They come and go in all directions, even after starting, not always
preserving the original direction.&nbsp; They are less common on days
in which winds prevail from any given direction, and vary much in intensity
from a mere breeze, lightly laden with dust and with no tortuosity,
to a violent cone of wind, capable of throwing down a <i>soldari</i>.</p>
<p>Northerly winds are prevalent here from 1 or 2 P.M.&nbsp; until 8
or 9 P.M., occasionally they only commence in the evening, when they
are obviously due to the rarefaction of the air of the valleys by the
great heat of the sun, amounting now to 100&deg; at 3 P.M., and the
vacuum being supplied by gusts from the high mountains to the north
and north-east.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>
<p><i>From</i> <i>Peshawur</i> <i>to</i> <i>Pushut</i>.</p>
<p><i>January</i> <i>8th</i>.&mdash;At Ichardeh.&nbsp; Between Busoollah
and Lalpoor are three curious low ridges, none above sixty feet high,
and all of small extent; they are covered with fractured masses of rock
of the same size as those strewn so liberally about the shingly slopes;
but they are much cleaner or fresher looking, and appear to me less
worn.&nbsp; Whence do they derive their singular situation?&nbsp; They
occur in such numbers, that one would at first think they originated
from a mass of ruins, but the ridges present scarcely any surface for
buildings to stand upon, certainly not to such extent as would account
for the abundance of these fragments.</p>
<p>About Huzarnow and on both sides, low ridges of sand occur.&nbsp;
In this sand graves are usually dug, and in some places to an extent
indicating dreadful devastations from disease, each grave is headed
by a stone, and about every ramification of the irregular size of the
burial ground, there is a building of the usual mud structure, designed
for a mosque, but not domed as is customary in Mussulman cemeteries,
but ornamented with flagstaffs bearing white bits of cloth.&nbsp; These
low sand ridges are often very much undulated; they consist of a very
fine powder, and at Huzarnow are evidently of the same nature as the
cultivated soil: they are neither in attachment as it were to the neighbouring
hills, nor distinct from them, but always have some communication with
the shingly slopes, to which they are evidently inferior.</p>
<p>So that the base of Khorassan may be taken to be the tillable portions,
over which occur, to a vast extent, the shingly very barren slopes,
which every section shows to be nothing but a mass of debris, resting
on the mountain rocks.</p>
<p><i>9th</i>.&mdash;Ali-Baghan.&nbsp; To this the road is good, along
the right bank of the river, wherever it does not wind along over the
spurs forming a considerable part of the march.&nbsp; To the first point
where this occurs, it extends over the same sort of plain as that about
Ichardeh; keeping rather close to the bank of the river, it is good,
also through the valley of Gundikuss, and from near the <i>Choky</i>,
to Ali-Baghan.</p>
<p>The first rocky ridge is about three-quarters of a mile in length,
and is not very difficult; at the end near Gundikuss, is a curious ruin
built into the stream, where the latter runs with violence on the rocky
bank: it consists of a broadish pathway, with a wall on the river side,
breast high; the masonry is good and solid, of the usual Bactrian materials,
but well cemented; it has mostly been ruined by the river, only one
end being perfect.&nbsp; Although the materials are <i>Bactrian</i>,
the contour is Mussulman, and I was told by some people that it was
a Mussulman erection: originally it perhaps extended all along this
part, as slight traces here and there are discernible; for what use
the original structure was intended I know not, as there are no remains
visible of a fort.</p>
<p>The inlet of Gundikuss is well cultivated, the village itself a large
straggling one, built close under a ridge.</p>
<p>From this to the <i>Choky</i> the path is rocky, and in many places
very bad, consisting of a series of ascents and descents, and winding
round spurs; in the worst place, the path almost overhangs the river
200 feet above its bed, and it is very hard and very rocky.&nbsp; The
distance between ten or eleven miles, the road is impracticable for
guns, etc. nor could our camels with loads well get over it.</p>
<p><i>10th</i>.&mdash;To Camp at the Bussout river, nothing remarkable
occurred; immense quantities of Serratuloides on the sandy raviny parts
of the road.&nbsp; Crossed the river on the usual <i>mussuck</i> rafts,
the animals forded it, at the quiet head of a rapid, water breast deep:
this river is smaller than that from Kooner.</p>
<p><i>11th</i>.&mdash;To Bussout, five miles.&nbsp; A village passed
about one and quarter mile up Kooner ghat, here a mile broad.&nbsp;
No change in the features of the country, which throughout is well cultivated;
here and there abundance of sedges, in the low ground; plenty of watercuts,
but none of any great size: road worse at the entrance of the ghat rounding
the east boundary, but guns might avoid this ground by keeping towards
centre of the ghat.</p>
<p>12th.&mdash;To Sha-i-wa, distance 8 miles.&nbsp; The road after turning
the angle of Bussout ghat, passed entirely through cultivation, villages,
trees and inhabitants more numerous than in any other place, cuts numerous,
but the road altogether from this cause and the cultivated fields very
bad.&nbsp; Rubus found along cuts at Chunar-Bukkeen.&nbsp; <i>Toot</i>,
<i>Ph&aelig;nix</i>.&nbsp; Vines numerous, of large size, running up
mulberry trees; forests seen on Kooner mountain?&nbsp; <i>Umlook</i>
and <i>Julghogal</i>, very common grain, very dear.&nbsp; The women
are generally clothed in dark blue <i>Noorgul</i>.&nbsp; The road now
extends up a gorge to our front, named Durrah.</p>
<p>Gooraiek fort on the opposite side.</p>
<p><i>13th</i>.&mdash;Halted.&nbsp; River much clearer than that of
Jallalabad; its bed affords abundance of large grass.</p>
<p><i>14th</i>.&mdash;Rejoined camp, keeping on the north bank of river.&nbsp;
The road passed over tillable recesses among the hills forming the north
boundary of Kooner valley, and over the spurs dividing these, of which
the first is short but bad, the last is a mile long, road infamous,
narrow, rocky, and in some places overhanging the river.&nbsp; I was
attacked about a mile and a half from camp, my servant Abdool Boyak,
the bravest and most trustworthy Asiatic I ever saw, wounded, losing
the two first fingers of his right hand; this was opposite the old Fort,
Noorgul, which is a dilapidated <i>kafir</i> ruin on a low island in
the centre of the valley and river, a strong position. <a name="citation435"></a><a href="#footnote435">{435}</a>
Other ruins occur on the road, one near Sek-Syud, the spur being covered
with its remains.</p>
<p>After leaving Deh-Syud, the valley becomes contracted; the river
occupying almost all its level portion, being much spread out, and with
numerous grassy islands; the cultivation occurring in the recesses between
the banks of the rivers and the glacis slopes.</p>
<p><i>15th</i>.&mdash;To Kooner, the road passes to Noorgul, an old
<i>kafir</i> fort, done up and occupied by Kooneriles, to its south-west,
three-quarters of a mile a hostile fort is situated.&nbsp; The ferry
is about two miles from Noorgul, and is with difficulty fordable: the
streams, three in number, the last almost brim full, and very rapid;
thence to Kooner is over a cultivated country.</p>
<p>Noorgul is on a commanding position, the ground rising gradually
on all sides to it; the valley here is very narrow.&nbsp; Observed Cnicus,
Fumaria, Lotus, Anagallis c&aelig;rulea, and Veronica agrestis, springing
up: trees continue the same to about Kooner: some fine plane trees observed.</p>
<p>All the mountains are wooded at a certain height, and in greater
quantities, very different however from Himalayan forests, being dotted
in parts, rather than uniformly clothed with forest, Andropogon one
of the ordinary spring forms: the <i>churs</i> or islands in the river
are also covered with Andropogoneous vegetation.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;To Pushut, or rather to within one mile of it,
rain throughout the day accompanied by an unpleasant wind down the valley.&nbsp;
Road except for the first mile, during which it passed through cultivation,
troublesome, otherwise with the exception of two ravines, at one of
which the horses were taken out of the guns, very good: valley narrow,
say three miles, the boundary ridges to the north presenting as it were,
truncate faces to the valley, all the mountains at certain heights are
well wooded.</p>
<p><i>17th</i>.&mdash;Rain continued since, almost without intermission,
very dirty weather, but no wind.</p>
<p>Snow on the hills around, almost within 1,500 to 2,000 feet of this,
the mountains to the south are well wooded, the woods occurring here
and there in forests; snow is said to fall here occasionally.</p>
<p><i>18th</i>.&mdash;The attack took place this morning, and failed
on account of the weather, which was sufficient to damp any thing, and
which prevented the powder bags from exploding, as well as a second
cask of cartridges.&nbsp; The men were withdrawn about twelve, rain
pouring down, ammunition of the guns being expended, and that for musquetry
quite useless; a few more rounds would have demolished the entrance
gateway and brought it down bodily; loss severe, twenty five men killed,
thirty-two wounded, several dangerously.&nbsp; The fort was well defended,
and evidently by a mere handful of people.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;Last night the fort was evacuated as well as that
on the opposite side, and the Syud has made off into the hills.&nbsp;
It cleared up in the morning but is now as threatening as ever, the
ditch of the fort is twelve or fifteen feet deep, but like all Affghan
ditches it is narrow.&nbsp; The parapets were very slight, so that a
more powerful battery would have kept down their fire completely; no
injury had occurred to the inner gate except its being off one of its
hinges, or rather out of one of its sockets.&nbsp; The entrance <i>was</i>
<i>thus</i> <i>round</i> <i>the</i> <i>gate</i>, not through the gateway:
it was protected by a thick screen of brushwood and mud, all of the
shots from the second position had lodged in the wall close to the side
of the gate; every thing was carried off, except a little grain, and
some gunpowder.</p>
<p><i>20th</i>.&mdash;Continued rain.</p>
<p><i>21st</i>.&mdash;Snow within 500 feet.</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Moved camp.</p>
<p><i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Continued rain and sleet, almost passing into
snow.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>Desideratum</i>.&mdash;Required to ascertain positively whether
the shingle and boulders are in all cases not derived from the boundary
mountains: that they are not in many cases is clear, witness the declivities
of slate rocks, totally incapable of assuming the form of boulders.&nbsp;
The proportions of the cultivated to the uncultivatable land is previously
given rather in favour of the tillable portion, this is always a light,
almost impalpable powder, consistent when wetted: generally the soil
owes any fertile qualities it has here, to the presence of water; thus
the Dusht-i-Bedowlut produces nothing beyond its indigenous plants from
having no water.</p>
<p>The transition from the extremely bare mountains of the Hindoo-koosh
as seen on the road to Bamean, to the well wooded ones of the Himalaya,
takes place at Jugdulluck, the hills, round which, produce plenty of
Baloot: in this direction, the forests become much thicker as we proceed
to the eastward.&nbsp; There is a mountain near Jallalabad, which at
once arrests the attention from its being wooded.&nbsp; Nothing like
it occurring between this and Cabul, on any part of the chain of mountains
distinctly referrable to the Himalayas.&nbsp; Wooded as this is, it
is nothing to the woods on the mountains about Pushut, the size of these
has been well demonstrated by the late snows: some bare places occur,
which appearances, Abdool says are from cultivation of Kohistanes.&nbsp;
Baloot abounds, Dodonea also is now coming into flower! a curious fact
pointing out its northern qualifications, although in form it is very
like a Mergui Dodonea.</p>
<p><i>24th</i>.&mdash;A clear day after a night of heavy rain, still
no appearance of settled weather; walked in the afternoon towards the
Dhurrah at the south side of the valley.&nbsp; The bouldery slope presented
an abrupt bank of a considerable angle, and its limits were most marked
from that of the tillable soil; as we approached the foot of the ghat,
the fragments became larger, they are angular, and have been little
if at all worn; thence I walked eastwards to a small isolated ridge
of limestone, perhaps a mile from the foot of the boundary chain, and
returned to camp.&nbsp; In this direction, which is that of the torrents,
occasionally rushing out of the Dhurrah, the transition between the
mountain slope, and the tillable soil, was gradual, the action of water
carrying farther down small fragments, and turning some of the fields
into a sandy shingly soil: the depth of the beds of these torrents here,
is perhaps four feet, the section being a mass of very unequal fragments.</p>
<p>I am not certain whether these fragments are derived from the mountains
or not, they seem to be too varied, and too widely spread for that,
although the course of the occasional torrents must vary very much.</p>
<p>Another puzzling thing is, that in the section afforded by the ditch
of the fort, and which is seventeen feet deep, the shingle underlies
the tillable soil.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the slopes here partakes of the nature of the Khyber
pass, the prevailing feature consists in coarse tufts of Andropogonous
grasses, Lycioides occurs, also Periplocea, also Cryptandoid, Euonymus,
these are on the cliffy ridge of limestone alluded to, 2 sp. of Astragalus,
Solanum jacquini? Sch&aelig;nanthus, Sedoides pictum very common, a
small fern, apparently a Cryptogramma, Grimonia, Tortula, a Bryum, three
or four lichens, one Marchantiacea found under boulders or in crevices
of rocks, one Salsola, Fagonia, Dianthoid, Statice common, Onosma, Artemisia
one or two, a large Cnicoid.</p>
<p>The only new feature is a shrubby dwarf fragrant Composita, foliis
albis subobovatis, dentatis grossiusculi margine revolutis.</p>
<p><i>24th</i>.&mdash;A break after a very wet night, cloudy throughout
the day.</p>
<p><i>25th</i>.&mdash;A fine day, particularly towards evening, beautifully
clear.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;No rain, but very cloudy, cold north-east wind.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;Rain very threatening, a disgusting country in
which it is impossible to take exercise without a strong guard: no means
of access to the beautiful forests visible in several directions, and
the natives are so intractable that it is impossible to induce them
to bring in specimens of their various trees, the only things about
which I am anxious.</p>
<p>In the meantime I have begun to use the theodolite, and getting approximations
to the height of those peaks remarkable for their features of vegetation.</p>
<p>It is curious that no pines are visible on any range south of the
Kooner river, until we reach those heights on the opposite side of a
very conspicuous ravine, up which the Bajore road runs.&nbsp; To the
north, on all the ranges of sufficient height, fine forests are visible,
especially of firs, other large-crowned trees exist, forming the bulk
of the forests, below the limit of the pines, but never grouped as those
are, but occurring isolatedly, these I call generally, <i>Baloot</i>
woods, i.e. Quercus <i>Baloot</i>.</p>
<p>The only means I have of gaining any idea of the composition of these
forests, are derived from the twigs and branches, which are used by
the natives as pads for the loads of <i>wood</i> which they bring into
for sale, and which almost consequently are from the lowermost limits
of woody vegetation.&nbsp; To go among the woods unguarded, is impossible,
and secondly, the weather is very bad.</p>
<p><i>Memoranda</i>.&mdash;That it cannot always be deficiency of soil
which causes the extreme barrenness of the usual Khorassan mountains,
because on the Kalo Pass to Bamean, nearly 13,000 feet high, the soil
is abundant; but in this case, height may interfere.</p>
<p>It is obvious between Kooner and Cabul, that the transition from
absolutely treeless mountains to well-wooded ones occurs nearer to Kooner
than Cabul, because the Hindoo-koosh about Cabul, and to the eastward,
is said to be treeless.</p>
<p>How interesting will the examination of these woods be, how different
will be their flora from that of Khorassan proper!</p>
<p>To define the Khorassan Province also, by its being destitute of
wood or trees.&nbsp; Note its passing off from this character between
Ghuzni and Quettah, see Marryott&rsquo;s letter about Kooner, compare
with <i>Mazenderam</i> <i>forests</i>.&nbsp; Fine plane trees occur
here, all the vines are trained on mulberries.&nbsp; What is Burnes&rsquo;
holly oak, or lily oak?</p>
<p>Rubus occurs, Ranunculus stolonifolia, a cold season plant, Euphorbia
ditto, and the usual Peshawur forms.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;Fine weather; clouds however, still flying about.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;A fine morning; in the afternoon threatening,
night cloudy, all the clouds come down the ravine! except when the wind
occasionally shifts to west.</p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;Fine weather, although still unsettled.&nbsp;
I procured the other day a few specimens of trees from the hills to
the south of this, among these which amount only to a few, are one Myrtus,
an Olenia, both of which bear me out in assuming that the woody vegetations
of these hills will present a curious transition between the genuine
Australio-European and the Himalayan forms.</p>
<p><i>31st</i>.&mdash;Almost every isolated rock in this country is
covered with ruins which vary much in extent, and are often barely perceptible,
but careful looking will detect them in all situations about gorges,
and such places.&nbsp; From the rivers running under rocks, the paths
which must be resorted to, at least at this season, are very difficult.&nbsp;
It would be curious to speculate on the different state of preservation
of these ruins, and the singular people to whom they are due.</p>
<p>The soil of this valley is very deep in places: in one place on the
opposite side of the river, it is twenty-five feet at least, the depth
obviously diminishing towards the bed of the river, or the lowest part
of the valley.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m440.jpg">
<img alt="Section through river valley" src="images/m440.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In this valley, at least about here, curious round thatched huts
are visible about villages, intended for religious females, they are
closed except at a small door.</p>
<p>Cotton much cultivated.</p>
<p>The <i>Jala</i>, or float skins used for crossing rivers, are inflated
by <i>bellows</i> of the usual description, this causes delay as some
require to be inflated very often owing to the eagerness of those who
want to be ferried over, and who rush indiscriminately on the <i>Jala</i>
which, from the rafts being few and far apart, occasion delay; such
ferries were not intended for impatient travellers; nothing can show
the want of intelligence of the people more than this abominably slow
method of crossing rivers; here, there is little excuse for it, as wood
is abundant.</p>
<p>The Culminating peak to the west of the north Dhurrah, shows that
here, as elsewhere, snow lies longer on the north than south sides:
it also affords a curious instance of the various disposition of snow:
those angles of its faces presented to the south having none, or little
snow; or does this depend upon the faces having different declivities?</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;First part of last night clear;
but the wind shifting from west to north-east, has again thoroughly
clouded the sky, night beautifully clear, no rain, and no wind during
the day.</p>
<p><i>2nd</i>.&mdash;A windy but clear night, succeeded by a beautiful
morning, wind as usual, north-east or thereabouts, i.e. down the river.</p>
<p>I have seen it mentioned somewhere, that in arid climates the only
support of vegetable life exists in the dews, which are hence, at least
in the cases alluded to, supposed to be providential adaptations to
supply certain deficiencies.&nbsp; But considering that dews consist
of nothing but a deposition of moisture: it follows that in very arid
climates, as there is no moisture, so there can be no dews.&nbsp; For
the deposition of a dew, the fist essential thing, is moisture, either
in the ground or in the air, this last may have been derived from the
ground.&nbsp; If neither the ground nor the air contain moisture, no
dews can exist, this is the case in Khorassan.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole campaign no dews were noticed, although the
nights were almost uniformly serene and calm, and the time chosen for
marching, would have certainly brought us in contact with them had they
been deposited.&nbsp; Dews therefore do not form in Khorassan, <i>with</i>
<i>these</i> <i>exceptions</i>, that wherever from the nature, and the
level of the soil, water was found very near the surface, dews were
deposited; as on the <i>Chummums</i> or low marshy pasturages at Candahar,
Cabul, etc.</p>
<p>But even these were trifling, the aridity of the air being too great
as compared with the small extent of Chummums, to allow the deposit
of any considerable portion of the moisture it had derived from the
ground.</p>
<p>So that aridity, instead of being adapted to dews, is a serious obstacle
to their ever appearing.&nbsp; With the rarity of dew, that of hoarfrost
which is nothing but frozen dew, may be associated; nor does hoarfrost
often occur, because in Khorassan it rains in the winter too freely,
particularly in all such places whose elevation is not sufficient to
cause the formation of snow, and hence where other circumstances are
favourable for hoarfrosts, <i>they</i> <i>are</i> <i>too</i> <i>much</i>
<i>watered</i> as it were, and seldom occur.&nbsp; With extreme aridity,
Khorassan unites extreme electricity, the casual friction of woollen
cloths, especially those of camels&rsquo; hair being accompanied by
discharges sufficiently startling.&nbsp; The same thing happens when
caressing dogs or horses.&nbsp; I could never fill the barometer without
experiencing a shock as the mercury approached the <i>bottom</i> <i>end</i>
of the tube, which (when nervous) used to endanger it.</p>
<p>It is this extreme aridity that gives Khorassan so rich a spring
flora, this season being that of rain, of melting of snow, and the ground
being well moistened.</p>
<p>It is this extreme aridity that necessitates the abundance of bulbous
plants in Khorassan, these deposits of nutrition existing even in several
of its Composit&aelig;.</p>
<p>Query&mdash;Why are Carduace&aelig;, (Artemisia) so adapted to aridity?</p>
<p>The region of Carduace&aelig;, commences about Ghuzni, and extends
to <i>Maidan</i> or Cabul, it is at its maximum about Shaikabad and
Huftasya.&nbsp; The abundance of Carduace&aelig; on the higher grounds,
as for instance towards Bamean, belong rather to a vernal flora.</p>
<p>I hope to be particular in hereafter comparing the floras of all
the deserts? and to notice the absurd remarks of some travellers in
Khoristhan, on the domesticated parasitic nature of the watermelon plant,
on the Hedysarum Alhagi, <i>Shooturkari</i>.</p>
<p><i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Fine moderate north-east wind, very clear.</p>
<p><i>4th</i>.&mdash;Over-clouded.</p>
<p><i>5th</i>.&mdash;Rain.</p>
<p><i>6th</i>.&mdash;Unsettled.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;Rain, thunder, distant lightning occasionally last
night.</p>
<p><i>8th</i>.&mdash;Fine: ice in the morning, thermometer five feet
from the ground 35&deg; at 7 A.M.</p>
<p><i>9th</i>.&mdash;Fine diffused clouds last night, succeeded by a
strong northeast wind.</p>
<p><i>10th</i>.&mdash;Fine.</p>
<p><i>11th</i>.&mdash;Fine in the morning, then threatening.</p>
<p><i>12th</i>.&mdash;Quite over-clouded, north-east wind.&nbsp; The
inferior level of snow is now several hundred feet above that which
it was at first.</p>
<p>Oxalis corniculata in abundance, what an universal plant this is.</p>
<p>All the natives of these parts wear sandals, those about the Khyber
being made of the leaves of a small Cham&aelig;rops, which is common
on the rocks of those mountains.</p>
<p>A proof of the extreme want of useful plants is seen in the fact,
that baskets are scarcely ever seen, all the loads of flour, etc. being
invariably carried in skins.</p>
<p>Leopards&rsquo; skins for the purpose are obtained from Chugur Serai,
Pullung and also Sofaid-Koh.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;The troops marched on their return.&nbsp; A lark
very much like the English species occurs in flocks; it is a stupid
bird, although obviously aware of its resemblance to clods of earth,
which it makes use of on every occasion when a little frightened.&nbsp;
The Gypa&euml;tos is also found here; it feeds principally on carrion.&nbsp;
I observed Trichrodroma for the first time here to-day, this bird is
by no means a powerful climber; indeed the individual seen to-day could
only cling, he was employed about sand banks of the irrigating canals,
etc. hopping from one likely spot to another, clinging here and there
momentarily, and always aiding himself in his inclined position by a
flutter of his wings; holes seemed always to attract him.&nbsp; It is
by no means a shy bird.&nbsp; I should observe however that I have seen
this species running up and down cliffs, so that perhaps the rather
loose sand would not give firm hold to his claws.</p>
<p>As I mentioned elsewhere, this bird is allied, at least in analogy
to Upupa, it has its precise habit of flight and a good deal of its
habits in looking for food, although the Hoopoe pokes about in the ground,
or rather hammers the ground alone.&nbsp; It is however fond of building
in holes of walls, it breeds at Punukka, in April.</p>
<p>I observed, and shot a weasel, or a <i>mungoose</i> to-day, whilst
it was employed feeding on the cast away skin of a goat or sheep, so
that some of these creatures evidently feed occasionally on carrion,
although they are said to live upon live prey.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>
<p><i>On</i> <i>the</i> <i>Reproductive</i> <i>Organs</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Acotyledonous</i> <i>plants</i>.</p>
<p><i>17th</i>.&mdash;Fine weather, the sun daily increasing in power,
is having a remarkable effect on the peculiar spring vegetation, but
this is not sufficiently developed to bring in the corresponding birds
and insects.&nbsp; Gypa&euml;tos is common now about the dead camels.</p>
<p>On the low east ridge, along the path that leads over the river,
ruins of ancient times are discernible, this only adds another to the
many proofs of similarly situated ruins, that the people who built them
have been located about Cabul, Jallalabad, and Peshawur, certainly not
about Candahar.</p>
<p>In the soil between the rocks, and in their crevices saturated with
moisture, most of the plants are just sprouting.&nbsp; Trichonema, Crocus,
and one or two other monocotyledons, Labiat&aelig;? Sedum three or four
species, exclusive of Sedoides foliis deltoides sphathulatis, and a
Stapelioid Asclepias, are to be found.&nbsp; I also got a new fern,
the fourth species out of 1,300 sp. it is a Ceterach or Grammitis, a
curious stalked snuff-ball, and one or two other Fungi, with an inverted
cap, were met with.</p>
<p>In the fields a young Ranunculus in profusion, Veronica agrestis,
Euphorbia, Festuca annua?</p>
<p>Kochia spinosa, and a curious Mathioloid are among the few wild plants
to be found about Pushut.</p>
<p>It would be a curious circumstance if all indusiate ferns were to
be found reducible to a <i>marginal</i> <i>production</i> of the reproductive
apparatus.&nbsp; I will bear this in mind, as certain forms of Pteris
or its affinities lead me to suspect that in these tribes the indusium
may be a long way from the margin, and yet be, quoad origin, marginal;
this section illustrates my meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m444.jpg">
<img alt="Fern sections" src="images/m444.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The transition to this might reasonably be suspected.&nbsp; The philosophy
of ferns is most ill understood, the higher points connected with them
have been quite neglected, and botanists in this as in other departments
of the science have been contented to confer names on certain external
forms, without sufficient regard to structure.</p>
<p>To-day I commenced examining Adiantum, with the view of determining
if possible the nature of its reproductive organs, and the mode in which
they are impregnated, if they are impregnated at all.</p>
<p>As I had long been aware that the fructification of each frond is
a thing to be determined at a very early period, and that if not determined
then, it is never likely to be determined afterwards, my attention was
directed more strongly, if possible, than it would have been otherwise,
to examining the subject at the earliest possible stage of its development.</p>
<p>The first piece examined gave me the idea that I had trouv&eacute;
le n&oelig;ud de l&rsquo;affair&eacute;; the second made me doubt this;
the subsequent ones went far to disprove it.</p>
<p>I was immediately struck with the resemblance of those organs, called
ramenta, to what are fairly assumed to be the male bodies, in certain
other families of the same grand division; and I at once came to the
conclusion, that the barren fronds, were barren, because almost destitute
of these ramenta; and that as these ramenta were confined to the base
of the stalk, that is, to the part below its first ramification, an
obvious necessity existed for the peculiar nature of the vernation.</p>
<p>Further examination of the thing, especially of the base of the stipes
and the adjoining part of the rhizoma, threw me back almost into my
original difficulties.&nbsp; I find that the rhizoma is entirely covered
with ramenta, which are brown, much detached at the base, and obviously
represent a low form of leaf, i.e. in appearance, perhaps partly in
function, but not in structure.&nbsp; Among these, mature ramenta at
the punctas of prolongation, which appear to be very irregular, are
concealed, others much smaller, and much narrower, (which bear as obvious
a resemblance, or even more so to the male organs of certain other orders,)
than the ramenta on the stipes.&nbsp; These are never entirely brown,
the end cell alone is coloured, but though occasionally tinged with
brown, they are filled with some fluid (even this is not so at first,)
but do not appear to open.&nbsp; I believe that subsequently all become
highly tinged with brown, but what increase of growth they subsequently
undergo, I know not.&nbsp; The terminal cell is always solitary, very
often attached to the one next it, which is generally single, obliquely
placed, occasionally looking like the dimidiate calyptra capping a young
seta.&nbsp; The number of cells forming the base, or dilated part varies,
but is always small in proportion to the larger ramenta, or protecting
scales: these last have a single terminal cell, which in fact must be
the same in every really cellular growth <i>sooner</i> <i>or</i> <i>later</i>,
the last degree of formative power being the production of a single
cell.</p>
<p>At a subsequent period, still an early one, the terminal cell is
fuscous-brown, and this colour then extends to the next in various degrees,
but if it reaches the basilar ones at all, it does so at late periods.&nbsp;
The base of the terminal cell, and parts of the parietes of the next
and next, present a coagulated appearance, precisely as in certain mosses.</p>
<p>No such thing as a petiolate leaf occurs in acrogens, all are attached
by a broad base?&nbsp; Of acrogenous leaves, those only are leaves whose
attachment is at right angles with the stem; the rest are divisions
of a frond.&nbsp; Thus far with the ramenta.&nbsp; The divisions of
the frond, are, I find, not gyrate, but rather cochleariform involate.&nbsp;
The future reproductiveness is settled at a very early period, and is
distinguishable under the microscope by a sort of <i>margination</i>
of the frondlets.&nbsp; In the earliest stage I have looked at, the
margin is greenish, striated by narrow cells, and passes into the body
of the leaf gradually; the greater development is perhaps central; even
now the bulk of the cells of the leaflet have green granules, and are
opaque from air.&nbsp; The vessels are marked out, or at least their
future course, and along them the opacity from air does not exist, so
that the veins appear depressed.</p>
<p>The next stage presented a greater development of an isolation of
the margin, but no other change.&nbsp; The next presented an isolation
of the margin, which remains almost white, the other part being green,
but more so because of a thickening as it were along the base of the
marginal part, and an evident deposit of grumous matter, from which,
under every circumstance new tissue seems always to be developed.&nbsp;
Pressure causes its discharge, its contents were unappreciated by my
poor instruments; after this the leaflets revert to the appearance of
the second stage.&nbsp; Here I ceased for the day, having I think ascertained
that ferns are endorhizal, and that the primary divisions of the roots
hence have sheaths, which adhere to the apex of the root itself.&mdash;What
a strange union of roots, that of monocotyledons in the main divisions,
and of pure acrogens in the minor!!</p>
<p>I cannot help thinking that the secret is hidden in these ramenta,
which, as is known, are so universal as obviously to have higher functions
than those of mere covering scales.&nbsp; The appearance of those I
have described as existing about the points of growth, are exactly the
same as the processes mixed with the anthers of mosses, and of which
the anthers are nothing but more developed growths; this would point
out, as indeed appears to me otherwise evident, (especially from consideration
of the theca, and its want of style,) that ferns are lower organised
as sexual beings than mosses and Hepatic&aelig;.&nbsp; I know nothing
of Lycopodine&aelig;, more than they are the highest of all acrogens;
and are not to be included in the same category with ferns.</p>
<p>The objection to the ramenta being anthers, will be the closed nature
(<i>apparently</i>) of the terminal cell, and although the anthers of
mosses do burst, and most especially those of Hepatic&aelig;, yet the
argument is not conclusive&mdash;inasmuch as <i>boyaux</i>, to which
they are analogous <i>do</i> <i>not</i> <i>open</i>?</p>
<p>These ramenta explain fully the nature of those confervoid organs
found in some Necker&aelig;, and perhaps in other mosses, and it becomes
paramount to prove whether these Necker&aelig; have also the usual anthers,
or if they are confined to these, in which case a presumptive proof
will thus be afforded of their functions: if they have both forms, they
will nevertheless constitute an analogous passage between the two orders:
if they have only <i>these</i>, such Necker&aelig; will form, as indeed
they do, a very distinct genus.</p>
<p>The nature of the barren fronds requires distinct analysis.&nbsp;
Are they barren from mere deficiency in supplies, such as may result
from many circumstances; or are the antheriform ramenta deficient?&nbsp;
They are barren from defective growth.&nbsp; I am aware how readily
objection may be taken to these views, some will say these young ramenta
are nothing but young scales as the older ones evidently are scales;
but this amounts to nothing, because we may expect simplicity in the
sexual organs of this division, and it will be only a proof of the uniformity
of nature in making so great a difference in a function depend on, or
be associated with so small a one in form.&nbsp; My view I think explains
their uniformly brown colour&mdash;analogous to Brown&rsquo;s sphacelation
in mutatis mutandis.</p>
<p>Others will say how absurd the idea is, when you cannot show the
place to which the impregnating influence is to be applied.&nbsp; But
the consideration of mosses does away with this objection partly, and
that of Anthoceros, entirely; because in mosses, the <i>ovule</i>, or
pre-existing cell, ready to receive the male influence becomes an empty
cell, terminating the seta; and the sporula become developed at its
opposite end, the first growth appearing to be quite unconnected with
that of the future reproductive organs: and in Anthoceros there is no
fixed punctum ready for the application of the male organs, but these
have to form a communication with the lower, or inferior cellular tissue
of the frond, before even the growth of seta can commence.</p>
<p>Besides a case in point exists in Viscum, or Loranthus, in which
no point is ready prepared for the reception of the male influence;
showing how universal the law is, that in no one point or place is there
an absolute want of gradation.</p>
<p>As in mosses the influence of the male <i>disregarding</i> <i>the</i>
<i>ovule</i>, is thrown into the development of the seta, and then of
the theca at the apex of this; there can be no conclusive reason why
in ferns the same influence should be thrown into the development of
the frond, and then into that of the theca.</p>
<p>While Anthoceros proves that in these orders the male influence may
exert its effects upon any point.</p>
<p>As there is no styliform production in Anthoceros, so there is none
in ferns.&nbsp; If the ramenta be anthers, they will not be dubious
ones, because as they remain fixed, people cannot say, that possibly
they are also reproductive bodies, which by the bye is no objection
at all, after instances of anthers bearing <i>ovules</i> instead of
pollen!</p>
<p>Why the peculiar distribution of the male influence (on which we
determine our genera,) takes place, is another question, and one that
cannot be fairly asked?</p>
<p>Why it is confined to the under surface perhaps can, it being a law
that in all cases it is the under surface of the leaf, or its modification,
from which new growths originate, and as nature has closed indusia,
how could the under surface be interior if this rule were not regularly
adhered to?</p>
<p>That the indusium is a <i>special</i> organ, i.e. not an eruption
of the cuticle, I am sure; hence it is essential to examine extensively
both indusiate and other forms, the precise extension of their veins,
etc. at an early period to ascertain if their most diversified situations
cannot be reduced to some one type.</p>
<p><i>Query</i>.&nbsp; Is the gyrate vernation of any ferns comparable
to the form of certain shells, to which (at least Mollusca) ferns are
supposed to be analogous.</p>
<p><i>Memo</i>.&nbsp; To ascertain the most peculiar, and most universal
points of Mollusca and Pseudo cotyledonea, it is in this way that we
may hope to extend our views.&nbsp; Some there are indeed who, while
the whole course of their studies has been to neglect structure, deny
the applicability of presumptive evidence in favour of doctrines, the
subjects of which are barely susceptible of direct proof.&nbsp; Thus
Greville and Arnott, angrily ask, what do persons mean by saying that
mosses have pistilla, etc.? they protest against such community of application
in the use of terms.&nbsp; Many more deny sexuality because it has not
been proved.&nbsp; Considering the invisible nature of the fluid of
the anthers of mosses, etc. how do they expect that we are to demonstrate
its application to the pistil, and the subsequent steps?&nbsp; As well
might they doubt the necessity of the application of the boyau to an
ovule, (or the existence of the boyau itself,) because the derivation
of the embryo cannot be proved.</p>
<p>One word more; in all cases the appearance of the reproductive body
after impregnation, is of late date; that date becomes later as we descend
the scale.&nbsp; The embryonary sac of Ph&aelig;nogams does not always
exist at the time of application of the boyau, and the appearance of
the embryo is always posterior to this.</p>
<p>Again, ferns are superior to mosses in this, that in many cases the
male influence is exerted directly on the parts that become the thec&aelig;,
which is not the case in mosses.</p>
<p><i>18th</i>.&mdash;Continued examining ferns, and to-day completes
my knowledge of the ramenta of three different genera.</p>
<p>In the first which is Cryptogamma, the resemblance of the young ramenta
to the anthers of Jungermannia is evident enough, they are capital,
and the head is at one period filled with granular matter: so are the
cells throughout, to a greater or less extent.&nbsp; They are to be
seen in all stages of development on the pinn&aelig; of a very young
frond, those near its base having perhaps effected their purpose, while
those at the apex of the pinna, or the prolonging part of pinnula, may
be formed of only one cell.&nbsp; It is curious that the terminal cell
does not become spherical for some time: in its earlier stages it is
cylindrical like the rest.</p>
<p>The appearances of the old ones are, if possible, more markedly in
favour of my hypothesis; there is the same aggregation of grumous <i>congealed</i>
matter about the ends of each cell, the same curious communication between
these masses which hide the septa from view, evincing a greater or less
tendency to assume the peculiar fuscesent or fusco-brown appearance.&nbsp;
I observed in two instances what appeared to me decided irregular openings
in the terminal cell, from one of which grumous filaments projected;
these appeared to communicate with the mass in the terminal cell, which
like that in all the others, is congealed; but it assumes a different
and very undefined form.</p>
<p>People may object and say, why were not more met with <i>opened</i>?&nbsp;
This is no objection, because it is obvious that a spherical body may
be opened in part of its surface, and yet unless this portion happens
to be on the <i>edge</i> as it were of the sphere, it may escape detection
with a microscope of poor penetration.</p>
<p>In this the ramenta are confined, or nearly so, to the under surface
of the fronds.&nbsp; Most occupy that which is called the costa.&nbsp;
In this the first change as in Adiantum is in the definition of the
margin.&nbsp; But this point I have not paid much attention to, as with
my present means here, it would be absurd to attempt <i>proving</i>
how the fecundation takes place; all that I can attempt is, to ascertain
from structure and analogy, the male nature of these curious bodies.</p>
<p><i>See</i> Plate <i>B</i> for the various sketches. <a name="citation450"></a><a href="#footnote450">{450}</a></p>
<p>The next genus examined, is perhaps the instance in which these ramenta
have the strongest resemblance to ordinary simple hairs, both in their
young, when they represent succulent, tinged, grumous molecular-containing
hairs, and in the old, when they represent long, flattened, coriaceous
hairs, still there is abundant evidence to prove that, however different
these bodies are in appearance from those of Cryptogamma, that they
undergo the same changes, excepting perhaps as to dehiscence.&nbsp;
We have a tendency to fuscous colouring, a tendency to the aggregation
of congealed matter about the sept&aelig;, precisely the places where
it is to be expected.&nbsp; The same appearance of a canal of communication,
the same irregular <i>constriction</i> of certain cells; in this too
the first change in the pinn&aelig;, or its component lobes, is the
definition of the margin.&nbsp; In this genus the under surface of the
frond is covered with these <i>hairy</i>-<i>form</i> bodies (which have
been figured over and over again in Hooker and Greville&rsquo;s ferns):
on the upper face, a few exist, but incomparably less developed.</p>
<p>From the examination of this genus alone, I do not think the idea
I have been so diffuse upon, would have struck me.</p>
<p>To-morrow I examine Ceterach, assured that the scales of its under
face are reducible to the same type.&nbsp; In a matter of such interest
and importance as this, many will, and with reason, dislike so important
an assumption on such inconclusive evidence.&nbsp; But with our present
means, it appears to me probable that no evidence to demonstration can
be looked for, and for this reason, that the contents of these peculiar
cells are so subtile as to escape definition even while in their cells,
(or under the most favourable circumstance for a concentration of attention.)&nbsp;
How much more so will this be the case, when we attempt to examine the
steps of the application of the fecundatory matter, applied over a surface
without any prominent points, and probably opaque.</p>
<p>When direct evidence is not to be had, we are justified in using
presumptive evidence.&nbsp; As in human law, so in the laws of nature,
presumptive evidence to a practised eye carries with it conviction.&nbsp;
We have no direct evidence how the embryo is formed, yet no one doubts
but that it is brought about by the agency of the boyau, which is a
cell containing grumous molecular matter.&nbsp; However different a
boyau may seem to many, yet when viewed in conjunction with Cycade&aelig;,
the graduation to the present case becomes natural, and even the resemblance
may be perfect, because in Cycas the grains of pollen get into the nucleus
bodily, although they would still seem to throw out short tails.</p>
<p>Wonderful is the simplicity of nature!&nbsp; The male organ in its
essence, consists of a single cell containing molecular matter.</p>
<p>The female in its essence consists of a single cell, likewise containing
similar matter.&nbsp; The influence of the male is exerted, and so another
cell is formed in the female cell, and this either becomes the embryo,
or gives origin to another cell, and so on, until the terminal one becomes
the embryo.</p>
<p>I believe from examination of the most developed scaly ramenta, that
these have at an earlier period been fecundating organs, the same peculiarities
are to be detected towards their ends, where in fact they retain their
original structure, the dilated base being a subsequent development.</p>
<p>In reference to this, the examination of young ferns on their arrival
at the age of puberty is indispensable.&nbsp; A curious question arises,
what is the frond of a fern?&nbsp; Is it a mass of foliaceous growth
containing certain lines of reproductive matter, or is it a distinct
development from the axis, in which the reproductive organs are situated?&nbsp;
Is it, or is it not, subservient to reproduction?&nbsp; Here again extensive
examination is necessary.</p>
<p>If it is altogether subordinate to reproduction, we may expect the
occurrence of far more simply constituted ferns than we are yet acquainted
with.&nbsp; In fact we may expect a form reduced to an axis, a few ramenta,
a frondose dilatation, and one punctum of reproductive organs.</p>
<p>With respect to duration, each frond is analogous to a single seta
of a moss, it has definite limits, and is unlike the fronds of certain
Hepatic&aelig;, which are capable of compound growth; or if this is
the case in ferns, as it is in viviparous ferns, the new formation becomes
separated from the frond, as a Ph&aelig;nogamous gemma does.&nbsp; This
is a question of importance, as perhaps it may prove that all the foliaceous
forms, except Lycopodium, Equisetum, and Chara, are frondose; the dorsal
situation is in favour of this assumption, since in all the genuine
frondose forms, the reproductive organs of both kinds originate immediately
from the under surface, although they may protrude through the upper.</p>
<p>I here ask, is there not <i>prim&acirc;</i> <i>facie</i> evidence
that these organs have peculiar functions; a peculiar form, attended
with peculiar changes, must have peculiar functions; and will any one
show me in any single instance, like circumstances to the like extent,
in any of those organs called hairs?&nbsp; By the bye, ferns themselves
may prove that however like these are to certain forms of hair, yet
that their functions are different, because the glandular hairs of ferns
do not undergo the same alterations, and are evidently nothing but hairs,
probably secretory.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;In Ceterach the same thing occurs precisely, with
this difference, that the <i>capita</i> of the ramenta are highly developed;
and still more, that the terminations of each pinnula of the young frond,
are mere scales without a terminal <i>head</i>.</p>
<p>So that almost all the scales of the under surface of the lobes of
the mature frond, are mere scales.&nbsp; The peculiar ramenta are to
be looked for along the insertion of each pinna, and along the rachis,
in which all have the peculiar structure.</p>
<p>At the time that these scales are commencing their development, the
peculiar ones are at the age of mature perfection, so far as function
goes.&nbsp; No one can look at a young pinnula at this epoch and observe
the evident capitation of each ramentum, the inflexion of its apex,
so that the head is brought into contact with the frond, without suspecting
that they have the same relation of <i>cause</i> to the appearance subsequently
of the thec&aelig; or capsules.&nbsp; It is curious that the colour
of the scales is the same as that of the ramenta, in which the colour
is developed from above <i>downwards</i>, a peculiarity as it appears
to me.</p>
<p>The frond of Ceterach is very frondose-looking, it has stomata on
its under surface, and the cells of the cuticle very sinuate.&nbsp;
There can be no doubt of the propriety of including the nature of these
ramenta and scales in its generic character.</p>
<p>I can see nothing peculiar in the situation of the scales or ramenta
to suggest the reason of the situation of the capsules.</p>
<p>In several cases, each pinna appears to have scales only which become
barren lobes? the scales and ramenta have the same imbricate situation.&nbsp;
In this country it will be useless to expect more proofs.&nbsp; But
the four genera alluded to afford evidence enough, and sufficient to
show that these ramenta are formed with reference to some important
function, that their universality is incompatible with any functions
of such minor degree as are attributed to them by those who represent
them to be scales or hairs.</p>
<p>To those who require proof of the existence of the complex male organ
of Ph&aelig;nogams, or of a male of that form with which only they are
familiar, I do not address myself; but to the philosophic botanist,
who expects to meet with in the lower orders of plants, a lower organization,
one with a tendency of reduction to the essential elements, and who
bears in mind the comparative anatomy and structure of similar bodies
in adjoining, or not very distant groups, I beg leave to suggest the
intimate study of the ramenta of Ferns.</p>
<p>Various as the situation of the fructification is, in three out of
the above four genera, yet the initial arrangements are precisely the
same.&nbsp; The various forms therefore may not depend proximately on
fructification itself, but on the peculiar growth given to the species,
in the same way in fact as we have the numerous modifications of the
theca in mosses, etc. and the infinite modifications of the carpels
in Ph&aelig;nogams.</p>
<p>(Attention is particularly pointed to those ferns which have general
capsules or involucres.</p>
<p>Above all to the Cyatheoid forms.</p>
<p>To Ophioglossum.</p>
<p>To naked Thec&aelig;.</p>
<p>To indusiate as Asplenia, etc.)</p>
<p>But however erroneous these views may be, they will still have been
of service if general attention is directed by them to plants, in consequence
of the suggestions they make.&nbsp; The time now thrown away on isolated
species, the station of which, still does not become fixed, when devoted
to the philosophical examination of ferns, will rescue botany from one
of its numerous reproaches.&nbsp; It is strange that such should exist
to the greatest degree in all those families stamped by nature as most
distinct.&nbsp; Those chaoses Polypodium, Aspidium, Davallia, would
then undergo distinct creation, and the primary divisions of the family
would become fixed; and we should then be spared the reproach of drawing
characters from organs, of the nature and functions of which we are
quite ignorant of, and of the importance of which in a science of demonstration
like that of botany, it is impossible to judge, without a true knowledge
of structure.</p>
<p>Vide Lindley&rsquo;s Introd. ed. 2, 407, for the protest of Greville
and Arnott.</p>
<p>What is the most comprehensive definition of a pistil.&nbsp; A case
in which the future organs of reproduction are developed; and here is
a most curious circumstance, namely, that though the calyptra, which
is a genuine pistillum containing an <i>ovulum</i>, becomes torn up
from its base, yet it remains in contact with that part of the seta
in which the sporules are developed until these make their appearance,
or even later!! so that one might as well deny a pistillum to a Reseda,
or Leontice, as deny it to these plants on the strength of its being
torn from its attachments.&nbsp; Sprengel&rsquo;s objections are worthy
only of being noticed from their having been quoted by Lindley.&nbsp;
The vagueness of his statement destroys all weight.</p>
<p>His objections in all cases amount to the fact, that the <i>stellul&aelig;</i>
or <i>buds</i> containing the anthers are capable of growth.&nbsp; So
is the prolongation of an axis of Ananassa.</p>
<p>A Gemma has a general character in its formation as well as an anther,
or as pollen; one is a congeries of cellular tissue, with or without
vessels, the other a sac consisting of a single cell containing active
molecular matter.&nbsp; As an anther producing a single grain of pollen
is not inconsistent with our notions of structure, so neither is an
anther consisting of a single grain of pollen.</p>
<p>Will any one show me an instance of a proved gemma taking upon itself
the form of one of these anthers?&nbsp; Will any show an instance of
a sac containing fluid matter capable of growth <i>after</i> <i>dehiscence</i>.&nbsp;
The real gemm&aelig; of the Hepatic&aelig; puts the question of gemm&aelig;
out of doubt.&nbsp; Is there any plant existing with two sorts of gemm&aelig;,
so differently constituted?&nbsp; Many ph&aelig;nogams have gemma in
addition to sexes, so have Hepatic&aelig;.&nbsp; Which is the most probable?&nbsp;
That they should have no sexes, reproductive organs, and two sorts of
gemm&aelig;, or sexes, reproductive organs, or gemm&aelig; of one evident
kind?</p>
<p>I cannot adopt the belief of any one having seen the germination
of the powder in the axillary bodies, that is, if applicable to the
organs I take for anthers.</p>
<p>(<i>Memorandum</i>.&mdash;To draw up a parallel between the two sets
of organs, and the steps followed in the development of each.)</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>
<p><i>From</i> <i>Pushut</i> <i>to</i> <i>Kettore</i> <i>and</i> <i>Barowl</i>
<i>in</i> <i>Kaffiristan</i>, <i>and</i> <i>return</i> <i>to</i> <i>Pushut</i>
<i>and</i> <i>Cabul</i>.</p>
<p><i>February</i> <i>20th</i>.&mdash;Fumaria found.</p>
<p><i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Cloudy, threatening rain.&nbsp; Swallows coming
in, also Fringillaria, with blackish cheek-streaks, also Pyrgita alia,
starlings uncommon up to this day about the site of the camp, where
there is much straw, and camels are lying.&nbsp; Flocks of <i>rooks</i>,
genuine rooks, flocks of daws, <i>minas</i>, pigeons, and many carrion
crows have been daily resorting to camp, all very wild from being constantly
fired at, as in this country every man almost has a matchlock.&nbsp;
No Gypa&euml;tos seen for several days.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;Fine weather after two days uncertain, in which
the large-headed lark has just come in abundance, this and the <i>English</i>
one frequent fields; the crystal one is found almost exclusively on
certain stony cultivated places: swallows have likewise arrived with
many wild fowl.&nbsp; Four raptorial birds are now seen about this,
or rather three, for Gypa&euml;tos has gone, viz. the common kite, or
one which looks much like it, a beautiful white slaty-blue and black
<i>harrier</i>, at least it comes about constantly, and looks much like
an Indian species, and much like one I shot high up in Bootan, together
with a large blackish and white one, with a <i>distinct</i> <i>collar</i>.&nbsp;
The fishing hawk, I saw it yesterday catch a large fish, making a strong
rapid plunge boldly into the water, and emerging again from it without
much difficulty; its habits except while fishing, are very sedentary,
and it seems to prefer <i>one</i> <i>spot</i>, viz. the top of some
particular tree, near perhaps its favourite feeding place.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;Another new bird has come in.&nbsp; A <i>Fringillina</i>,
with curious Flycatcher habits, I have only seen two individuals, they
perch towards the top of trees, and thence sally out after winged insects.&nbsp;
I examined the contents of its stomach, and found only seeds, gravel,
and soft insects.</p>
<p>The sun is increasing wonderfully in power, but the trees are not
as yet budded.&nbsp; Shrubby Polygone&aelig;, with flagellate branches
and leaves, in which the petiole is as much developed as the lamina,
form a curious feature of Affghan Flora; Euphorbia linifolia common,
the herbaceous one in profusion.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;Spring coming on rapidly, snow not within 2,000
feet of where it was twenty days back, and the sun oppressively hot;
winged ants in abundance: whenever this happens it proves the perfection
of the crows, which are on all such occasions to be seen acting the
part of flycatchers in addition to their various other callings, soaring
and sweeping round after these insects, but not returning as Merops
or real flycatchers to a fixed station.&nbsp; I have hitherto seen only
the jackdaws at this spot in Calcutta, but here the real crow mingles
in it.</p>
<p>In Calcutta, the common kite often acts a similar part, but catches
only <i>with</i> <i>its</i> <i>feet</i>.</p>
<p>A small kingfisher is to be found here <i>rarely</i>, it is much
like the Indian blue and reddish one, the white and black kingfisher
is not seen here, although found at Jallalabad.</p>
<p>The species of <i>sub</i>-wader, with a stout upturned beak, is a
true Grallator, yet is not always about water, but often in the driest
places; the genus has a flight strongly resembling that of certain Anatid&aelig;.</p>
<p>A <i>Monaul</i> pheasant, or some similar splendid bird is found
in the snows of Kaffiristan, all I have seen of it are a few feathers.</p>
<p>Merula more common, <i>Anthus</i>, <i>Timalia</i>, observed.</p>
<p>To-day one good specimen of a splendid pinus, allied to P. longifolia,
was brought from the mountains, where it is found <i>among</i> <i>snow</i>:
this makes the third species; one cultivated at Candahar near a mosque;
the short-leaved <i>Julghozeh</i>, from Tazeen; and this one which has
as fine a cone as can be wished.</p>
<p>Where did the profusion of Justicia Adhatoda which I find here come
from, is it not a distinct species?</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Chugur Serai, started
from the other side of the ferry at 11.30 A.M., and reached at 4 P.M.&nbsp;
No halt of any consequence on the road.&nbsp; Passed Nachung at 12.50:
the first rocky ground occurred at the narrow part of the north side
of the valley 2.25.</p>
<p>15th.&mdash;And thence to Chugur 4 P.M., distance certainly thirteen
miles.</p>
<p>Road decent, good about half-way, where it extends over cultivation
on firm ground, then over rocky, stony, raviny ground.&nbsp; From the
12.50 station, the valley becomes much narrower, and the river confined
to one bed: cultivation scanty, between this and Chugur, where, about
400 yards of excessively difficult ground occurred, commanded by the
precipice under which the path, which is execrable, runs.&nbsp; It is
quite impassable for guns.</p>
<p>After this the country traversed seemed to be well cultivated: and
even picturesque.</p>
<p>The fort is nothing particular; it is placed on the right bank of
the river, which is deep, narrow and raviny: descent to the river abrupt.&nbsp;
The bridge very richly ornamented, and of curious and simple Bootan
timber construction.</p>
<p>Town small, and the people very civil: I lodged in Meer Alum&rsquo;s
own house.</p>
<p>Iris crocifolia abundant, towards Chugur, a Mazus or Stemodia.</p>
<p>Mimosa that of the Khyber, common, Polygoni in abundance on the rocks,
Dodon&aelig;a.</p>
<p>The hills about Pushut are here only recognisable in two instances,
the central one presenting three peaks, next to it the barren cliff,
and the three mountains south-west of Dhurrah.</p>
<p><i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Bala Chugur Serai, which is not more
than six miles up the river, occasionally passing along the stony bank
under hills, otherwise over cultivation, which is conducted in terraces.</p>
<p>The scenery pretty, reminding me of low parts of Bootan, although
much more barren; watercourses well made: two <i>kafir</i> ruins passed;
valley very narrow, but rather straight.&nbsp; Both chakor and small
partridges common.&nbsp; Vegetation is here the same as elsewhere.&nbsp;
Zaitoon trees, Mimosa, Euonymus, Dodon&aelig;a, Amygdalus in abundance,
Polygonum of yesterday.</p>
<p>The stony slopes of hills, covered with Andropogoneous grasses.&nbsp;
Rice, beans, wheat, oranges, <i>toot</i>, <i>chanra</i>.&nbsp; Narcissus
in swarms, brought in from the <i>kafirs</i>.</p>
<p>Another bridge was here crossed, the same as at lower Chugur Serai.&nbsp;
No tributaries passed, the river fordable at rapids, but the road is
not passable for guns.</p>
<p>Aquila, Enicurus, Alcedo bengalensis common, as well as jack snipe.</p>
<p>Red-billed crow, chakor, yellow wagtail, Fringilla, Muscicapa in
flocks, feeding in the fields, and from trees on insects.</p>
<p>The blackbird of the Himalayas, wild pigeons.&nbsp; Narcissus in
abundance in sandy fields, Cryptandrioid, Clematis, Rubus, Euonymus,
Pteris!</p>
<p>We had an interview with the <i>kafirs</i> or infidels about a mile
below Katoor, they seemed at first much alarmed, our retinue not being
small or unarmed, and their reliance on Mussulman faith not very strong.&nbsp;
They took up their post at the foot of a hill where a deputation of
the Khan of Chugur Serai, (who has married a Chief&rsquo;s daughter)
met them; they received the deputation with a <i>feu</i> <i>de</i> <i>joie</i>
from one or two firelocks, and then accompanied him to us, preceded
by two drums, one of ordinary, the other of an hour-glass shape, and
two pipes of gramineous culm, with three or four holes, and apparently
oblique mouth-pieces, but of ordinary sound.&nbsp; The Chiefs, the head
of whom is Hussin Ali&rsquo;s father-in-law, having been introduced,
advanced, and commenced turning and stamping round a circle.</p>
<p>The usual formalities then took place; the followers, although a
fine bodied people, and very active, were excessively dirty, and not
very fair; most were dressed in skins, having the hair inside, armed
with bows, either straight or like cow&rsquo;s horns, and daggers.</p>
<p>The Chiefs were much fairer than their followers, and in the expression
of face and eyes European; but in all cases the forehead was very slanting,
and head generally badly developed.</p>
<p>Their dress consisted of cotton frocks, with slashed sleeves, embroidered
thickly with worsted network: they wear short <i>pyjamas</i>, and skin
shoes, with thick skin soles; one had short boots with hair inside:
most were ornamented with the blue and yellow <i>longhys</i> of Pushut,
etc.&nbsp; The hair is cut short except that of the Chiefs, who had
fillets left round their heads, adorned with cowries, in radiated shapes,
with a red, worsted, pendant tassel.&nbsp; The headman had a pendant
wire chain with ornaments, and from the centre of the tassel, the <i>Monaul</i>
pheasant feathers, and his back hair was plaited into many little tails.</p>
<p>Almost all had necklaces of beads, the better sort silver earrings
(plain rings), and some pendant silver ornaments; many had bracelets,
ornamented with brass; <i>kumurbunds</i> of plain white cloths: the
poor ones have their heads naked, or with bits of cloth wrapped round.</p>
<p>They had no swords, but Hindoostany ones, and of these very few.</p>
<p>Even their archery, Macgregor says is bad; one or two had spears,
the Chief&rsquo;s spear was provided with a very long head, and ornamented
with cowrie shells at the top of the <i>haft</i>; two women came afterwards,
their necks loaded with cowries and bits of bones, but otherwise well
clothed with the usual gowns, the outer one without sleeves and very
wide arm holes.&nbsp; They were decorated with very coarse, large, circular
earrings.&nbsp; They approached the rest singing in chorus, not unmelodiously,
but with very little variation in notes.&nbsp; Then a whistle, general
and loud from the whole party, representing their rejoicing over a slaughtered
Mussulman.</p>
<p>On the whole these people present nothing peculiar as compared with
other hill people: like them they are vindictive, savage, poor, dirty,
remarkable for great cupidity, fond of red cloth, beads, etc.&nbsp;
They are a mixed race, some are like Indians, some like Europeans, but
in all the forehead is low, Tartar eyes, often light brown or grey,
hair often light.&nbsp; Put them among the Nagas, etc. of the Assam
frontier, and none would notice them.</p>
<p>The Chief&rsquo;s son wore a black, narrow band round his head, ornamented
behind with a few cowries and bone ornaments.</p>
<p>They are independent, appear to delight in talking of their victories
over the Mussulmans, but the oddest peculiarity as compared with Asiatics,
is their shaking hands, which was certainly done with us in the European
custom.</p>
<p>The limits of the firs, are as strict as those of Baloot, etc., of
the latter it may be stated as between 3,500 to 5,600 feet, of the firs
between 5,500 and 8,000; what makes me say this is, that at Katoor the
mountains are covered with heavy snow, and are naked above, but with
heavy pine forest below, and then with forests of Baloot.</p>
<p><i>5th</i>.&mdash;Ascended the hills to about 200 feet above the
limits of inferior snow, which may be estimated at about 4,500 feet.</p>
<p>These hills from 3,500 feet and upwards, are well wooded, presenting
no peculiarity in the distribution of the woods, which are thin, or
thickish only in sheltered parts, down ravines, etc. but presenting
a great peculiarity in the small variety of forms, for there are not
more than three kinds of trees, and not more than a dozen shrubs: the
trees are Baloot, which commence at the base, and ascend to the pines,
say a height of 4,000 feet: Zaitoon, which commences at the base, and
scarcely extends beyond 5,000 feet, Xanthoxylon, which has a wider range
than Zaitoon, is comparatively rare.</p>
<p>The inclination of these hills is steep, but the ascent is not more
extraordinarily difficult, they are covered with masses and blocks of
rock, which are plentifully clothed with lichens and mosses, but of
small variety of species.&nbsp; The more open parts are covered with
Andropogoneous grasses; the lemon-grass occurs below.</p>
<p>The shrubs and trees are as follows with their Pushtoo names&mdash;</p>
<pre>Zanthoxylon,           <i>Schne&aelig;</i> <i>khinfuch</i>,
Quercus Baloot,        <i>Ichairraye</i>.
Olea,                  <i>Khoo</i>-<i>unn</i> <i>Zaitoon</i>.
Amygdalus,             <i>Budam</i>, <i>Junglee</i> <i>Tulk</i>.
Nanus,                 <i>Naguhn</i>.
Celtis,                <i>Tanghuh</i>.
Cyrtisoid of Bolan,    <i>Wooraijoa</i>.
Periploca,             <i>Burrara</i>, <i>Banduk</i>.
Cotoneaster of Tazeen, <i>Khurrowa</i>.
Euonymus,              <i>Churroghzye</i>.
Dodon&aelig;a ,              <i>Wroolarskye</i>.
Artemisia,             <i>Tuhakar</i>.
Rubus,                 <i>Khusuhurra</i>.</pre>
<p>The higher ridges are crowned with beautiful pines; the most common
on this side is called <i>Nukhtur</i>, and has not eatable seeds, its
timber is in general use&mdash;and it is in much vogue for torches.</p>
<p>The <i>Julghozeh</i> also is met with, but rarely.&nbsp; Abundance
of firewood.</p>
<p>Ixioides very common, and now in flower, Amygdalus, <i>Budam</i>,
also, this is common, and a curious Irideous plant, allied to Crocus;
one Arum likewise occurs.&nbsp; Pigeons very wary, mostly of the green
sort with whitish wing-coverts; a pretty small-sized Jay occurs, with
a jerking bobtailed flight, a strong-billed Parus, of the climbing sub-genus,
Chakors common.</p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>6th</i>.&mdash;Rain almost all day.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;Unsettled weather continues.&nbsp; To-day the <i>kafirs</i>
came in with plants of a decided Himalayan nature, a beautiful Iris,
the flowers of which are of a deep indigo-blue, a Viburnum, Euonymus,
Valeriana, Juniperus, Spir&aelig;acea, Adiantum, Asplenium, Pteris,
etc.</p>
<p>How strangely intelligent all hill people are, and how they are urged
by an insatiable love of money.&nbsp; I never expected any thing to
be brought in, judging of the <i>kafirs</i> as I have learnt to do of
Affghans and Indians, and here they have in one day, without even a
lesson, brought in excellent specimens, including mosses, etc.&nbsp;
I went out to-day to the end of Meer Alum&rsquo;s territory, this boundary
being about one and a quarter miles beyond Shingan.&nbsp; The valley
up to this is beautifully cultivated, and begins to look green.&nbsp;
Saw and shot another Myophonus, a Saxicola and an Alcedo, the common
one of India; this species has strengthening splints, as it were on
both mandibles: and the feet, etc. have no scales, being very different
from those of the generality of birds.</p>
<p>Myophonus I take to be the large beautiful metallic-blue blackbird,
with obscure and elegant white markings.&nbsp; I have observed common
to all hills I have seen, and is always found in damp wet places, this
bird is very wary, and in carriage much like the English blackbird,
on alighting from its short flight, flirting its tail about, etc.&nbsp;
This bird leads me to remark how widely the river chats are distributed.&nbsp;
The beautiful white-crowned black and red species, and the grey, with
a red tail, are found about all hill streams in the north-eastern parts
of India; the latter is a curious bird, radiating its tail out constantly.&nbsp;
Enicurus is also widely distributed.</p>
<p>I also got to-day a beautiful male Lophophorus, the plumage of which
surpasses description; it is a heavy bird, with brown irides, and a
brownish-chesnut tail; it came from Daiwag.</p>
<p>I met with five <i>kafirs</i>, when out to-day, only one would come
to me; he was a very tall man, with a savage face, light keen eyes,
returning from a forage on the Safis: he was an <i>Arunsha</i> man,
and a <i>Tor</i> <i>kafir</i>, who are represented as very different
from the <i>Espheen</i> or white ones, who are found in the mountains
adjacent to Balk, etc.&nbsp; Arunsha is three days journey from this,
and has a lame, or one-<i>legged</i> chief, <i>Dheemoo</i>; my friend&rsquo;s
name was <i>Bazaar</i>, he was armed with a matchlock taller than himself,
and the usual dagger.&nbsp; How they compete with the Mussulmans I cannot
imagine, as they can only fight in close quarters, and for which they
have daggers about six inches long in the blade.</p>
<p>The <i>Kafir</i> names of the plants brought in are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<pre>* <i>Praitsoo</i>,           Hedera.
  <i>Akrumah</i>,            Iris.
* <i>Kreemapotak</i>,        Melanthium.
  <i>Daisoo</i>,             Urtica urens?
* <i>Joh</i>,                Laricoides.
  <i>Wheeree</i>,            Ephedroides.

* <i>Unzoomal</i>,           Spire&aelig;a.
  <i>Gutsuttur</i>,          Viola.</pre>
<p>Of these, those marked with an asterisk have no affinity at all with
the Khorassan Flora: nothing can show the change in the Flora of Katoor
better than this, that two <i>kafirs</i> bring in one day, without having
their attention directed to ferns, as many species as I have obtained
in all that part of Khorassan I have visited, amounting to 1,000 miles
in different latitudes and at very various elevations.&nbsp; The following

<p>The mixture of Hindoostanee names is very curious indeed, particularly
those names of things which, from being indigenous, one would suppose
would have indigenous names.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;Went up to Bharowl and returned to-day, March 9th,
first went to Loongurze, the Barometer at which stood 24.758.&nbsp;
Therm. in sun 85&deg;.&nbsp; Bharowl is a small plain, but still three
or four times larger than Loongurze, and perhaps 100 feet below it:
this place is up the ravine leading to the fourth peak of the west side,
which same peak must be between 9,000 to 10,000 feet high.&nbsp; Loongurze
is visible from this, and is more to the south.</p>
<p>The villages consist of several houses forming a sort of wall; outside,
the houses are of one story, with terraced roof, supported by timbers,
they are built of stones, slabs of micaceous slate, which is the prevailing
rock, and timbers interposed as ties; the rooms are very dark, and very
dirty, with no outlet for the smoke.&nbsp; The only part of the furniture
worth noticing consists of an inverted conical basket, made out of the
stems of some large grass, coated with mud, and truncated at the top,
used to keep grain in.&nbsp; The under, or ground floor appears to be
used for the domestic animals which are cows, goats, fowls, etc.&nbsp;
The inhabitants of Bharowl, <i>Bhawiolis</i>, are a <i>kafir</i> race
with a Mussulman cast of countenance, but fair, of an unhealthy look,
with in many cases light hair, and generally light eyes, they are a
rather large tribe, and appear to have but few wants, are very poor,
and very dirty; the better part of the men are clothed in Cashgar, <i>chargas</i>,
and ordinary cotton under-garments; the women dress in blue.&nbsp; Both
villages are on the limit of inferior snow at this season; there is
enough of cultivation about to supply their wants, chiefly wheat and
barley, and a sort of pea.&nbsp; Loongurze is infested with a villainous
midge, of the same genus as that of the Naga Hills, but few are to be
found at Bharowl.</p>
<p>At Loongurze I met a Khungurlye slave, of the caste Krungurlye, the
head-quarters of which are at a mountain village, about eight <i>cos</i>
off, in a north-west direction.&nbsp; The chief of Koorungul is Ahmed
Khan, he is independent: his village having 400 men, well armed.</p>
<p>The man wore a goat skin jacket without sleeves, a skull cap of camel
hair netted, and leggings to the ancle of the same, to keep off the
midges; these leggings are likewise used at Bharowl for the same purpose.&nbsp;
The following is a specimen of the Krungurlye dialect.</p>
<pre><i>Baba</i>,      Father.       <i>Wurrik</i>,      Water.
<i>Aiee</i>,      Mother.       <i>Soourr</i>,      Hog.
<i>Lohideck</i>,  Brother.      <i>Kookoor</i>,     Fowl.
<i>Trizzai</i>,   Sister.       <i>Ow</i>,          Bread.
<i>Khleck</i>,    Woman.        <i>Trull</i>,       Jungul.
<i>Gillor</i>,    Horse.        <i>Psan</i>-<i>sa</i>,     Cat.</pre>
<p>The Krungurlies are said to have been <i>kafirs</i>, converted long
ago.&nbsp; They are now quite Mussulman in appearance.&nbsp; They were
doubtless originally a mixture of European and Tartar races driven by
persecution to the hills, to which they are still perhaps restricted
by the cause which led to their original isolation.</p>
<p>I tried to ascend the ridge, but the snow was impracticable even
within 700 feet of the village.&nbsp; The <i>Nakhtur</i>, or Pinus,
which is the prevailing feature above Bharowl, is the same as the Tazeen
one, and is a Cedrus or <i>Abils</i>, leaves very short, cones erect
and elegant, but only broken ones could be found.&nbsp; The ridge and
its face is quite covered with them, they grow singly.&nbsp; Huge masses
of micaceous rocks are scattered here and there, some are of gigantic
size.</p>
<p>The Baloot is the next most common tree, but I fancy it does not
extend beyond 7,500 feet; this is in general use for firewood, many
of the trees, especially below, are much damaged, and on these the leaves
are generally very thorny.&nbsp; Next is the Zaitoon, but it is not
common in this direction, although common a mile to the south on the
ridge first ascended.&nbsp; The soil is now saturated with snow water,
and appears good and plentiful.&nbsp; The want of soil is another reason
why the lower ranges are so barren, but this is just the contrary of
what would be expected.</p>
<p>In spite of the beauty and fineness of these forests, there is still
the Khorassan paucity of forms.&nbsp; Many herbaceous plants are doubtless
hid under the snow, but few shrubs were to be seen: the Mespilus of
Tazeen being the most common at 6,000 to 7,000 feet, a Thymus, Labiata,
Olea fragrans, Ocymoidea, two or three Crucifera; Sedum pictum observed,
and Melanthace&aelig; which has fragrant flowers, is very common.&nbsp;
The rocks are covered with mosses, Grimmia pulvinaloides, every where
in profusion.&nbsp; New forms consist of a fine Tortula and an Anictangioid,
with leaves white, and membranous from the middle upwards.</p>
<p>Birds, a black and white Erythaca, eyes fuscous-brown; the wood pigeon;
a jay, which is a beautiful bird, irides light brown; a small woodpecker,
with a greenish subcrest; the <i>Parus</i>; a thrush not obtained; Parus
c&aelig;rulens; a pretty red-crowned small Fringilla, eyes light brown;
common crow, chakor, bearded vulture; a wren, not obtained, with irides
light brown, but with exactly the manners of Troglodytis.&nbsp; Cham&aelig;rops,
<i>Maizurrye</i> used for netting ropes for bedsteads, Viscum of Baloot,
used for food of domestic animals.</p>
<p>Wild goats, sheep, an ass-like animal (<i>Goomasht</i>), and a fox
which is handsome, of large size, and common.</p>
<p><i>8th</i>.&mdash;Returned.</p>
<p>The <i>Kafirs</i> have a game exactly the same as the English leap-frog,
called by them <i>Shutruck</i>.&nbsp; They were very much astonished
at my understanding it.&nbsp; They are miserable marksmen, and were
even at small distances unable to strike a large object, as for instance
a hat at twenty yards, although offered a handsome reward; nor can they
shoot at all at long distances.&nbsp; They are in this respect quite
below Khasyas and Booteas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Ridge near Loongurze" src="images/m466.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>March</i> <i>9th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday evening a female of Lophophorus,
was brought in, and a beautiful pheasant, having claret-coloured neck.&nbsp;
Body otherwise fuscous and blackish-brown, having a blackish-green head,
white cheeks and fine transverse crest, as large as a middle-sized fowl.&nbsp;
Apparently a new subgenus of Phasianus.</p>
<p><i>11th</i>.&mdash;Swallows have now come in here.&nbsp; They are
apparently a different species from the Pushut kind.</p>
<p><i>12th</i>.&mdash;The large-headed lark has also come in, so that
there is a difference of twelve or fourteen days between this part of
the country and Pushut, where it was first seen, although this is only
500 feet higher, and about thirteen miles farther north.</p>
<p>The universality of the common crow is curious, especially when contrasted
with the circumscribed locality of Jackdaws.&nbsp; The Indian Jackdaw
is never found in hills.</p>
<p>A common plover was brought in yesterday, the wing quills had been
taken out, and its gestures on being liberated were most absurd, and
although originating from fright, were much allied to pride, its head
reclining on its neck, the latter curved, and the feet lifted high into
a stately walk, while the crest was disposed in a most supercilious
manner.</p>
<p>I have got into great request here as a physician, entirely I apprehend
owing to the people&rsquo;s faith in <i>vilayuti</i> <i>daroo</i>, or
English medicine, especially calomel and cream of tartar, a combination
of which has proved an universal panacea.</p>
<p>Goitre is common here, and the place in the hot months is said to
be very unhealthy, fever and jaundice carry off numbers of people.&nbsp;
The Affghans, strange to say, have no popular medicines, but they are
an unintelligent race in many other points.&nbsp; They are aware of
bloodletting, which they practise most indiscriminately.</p>
<p><i>13th</i>.&mdash;Unsettled weather.&nbsp; Heavy thunderstorm in
the evening with clouds over the western range.</p>
<p><i>14th</i>.&mdash;Beautifully clear, a genuine spring beauty on
all sides.</p>
<p>The common <i>Maina</i> of these parts is a gregarious bird, which
feeds generally on the ground, but is rarely associated with cattle,
to which the Indian species are so addicted: this is an intelligent
bird, although from its nature not unnecessarily shy.</p>
<p>It is fond of singing; its notes are very varied, but not very musical,
including all sorts of intonations.</p>
<p>While so employed, the bird every now and then bobs his head suddenly
down three or four times, much for the same purpose perhaps, as our
public singers in the production of certain notes.&nbsp; I do not know
whether these actions of the bird are really associated with particular
notes, although they generally seem to accompany certain very flat and
very base notes, not unlike the clerk of a coachman.</p>
<p>The snow is rapidly disappearing, rain having a most powerful effect
even at the summit of the pine ridges: it is fast melting, and no new
snow has fallen, although it has been raining occasionally during the
last three days, and the sun has been altogether obscured.</p>
<p>Generally on the high Kuttoor range, fresh snow has fallen, a proof
of the great height of that range.</p>
<p>Two species of Corydalis, the first Iris and Colchicum I had found
in Kaffiristan.&nbsp; Corydalis is another analogy with the genuine
Himalayan Flora.</p>
<p>Jackals were heard here for the first time, although they were heard
many days ago at Pushut.</p>
<p><i>15th</i>.&mdash;The antilopoid animal called Suja, has horns both
on the male and female, it occurs in small herds fifteen to twenty in
the wooded mountains, its hair is of the same structure as in the Moschiferus
antilope; colour brown.&nbsp; Height to the shoulder two feet six inches;
its height does not increase or decrease perceptibly behind; length
of neck seven inches.&nbsp; Length of back from root of tail to nape
of neck two feet eight inches.</p>
<p>The Lophophorus is called <i>Moorghi</i> <i>Zureem</i>, it is a very
gorgeously coloured bird, but of heavy make; the tail is always carried
erect.&nbsp; Length of body two feet one inch; the girth of the body
at the shoulder including wings, seventeen to eighteen inches.&nbsp;
Length of neck from commencement of the crest to the base of the under
mandible, five to six inches.</p>
<p>The bird is not uncommon, being found on all the hills about here,
and apparently at no great elevations.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;The <i>Ungoor</i>, Ficus cordifolia is the first
tree that buds.&nbsp; The Platanus, <i>Thagur</i>; Morus coming into
flower, vegetation being very rapid.</p>
<p>A captive fox brought in, a fine and a handsome animal, with greyish
fur inclining to fuscous on the back, and with blackish points at the
back of ears, which are large, and dark-brown; eyes light yellowish-brown.</p>
<p>Measured as follows from:&mdash;</p>
<pre>Shoulder to base of tail, 1 feet 3 inches.
Shoulder to tip of nose,  1 feet 0 inches.
Height at shoulder,       1 feet 4 inches.
Height at loins,          1 feet 6&frac12; inches.
Total length,             3 feet 8 inches.
Length of tail,           1 feet 7 inches.</pre>
<p>There is also a nocturnal beast here which has a voice something
like a jackal, but more of a bark.&nbsp; Shot one of the small grey,
white-rumped water robins, which was examining a wall for insects, and
fluttering about the holes in it.&nbsp; I saw two Carbos (cormorants),
distinct from any I had hitherto seen, very black, with some white marks.&nbsp;
The common black one also occurs.</p>
<p><i>17th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Chugur Pair; the time occupied by
the journey, excluding stoppages, was two hours and four minutes, at
the rate of three and a quarter miles an hour.</p>
<p>Tulipa in abundance in fields, a beautiful species, external sepals
rosy outside, odour faint but sweet.</p>
<p>On a ridge near Chugur Pair is a curious ruin, viz. a long wall.</p>
<p>The mountain is too high to enable me to say what it is like.&nbsp;
The tulip has a tendency to produce double flowers: one specimen seen
with a regular three-leaved perianth, eight stamina, and four carpellary
ovary, angles opposite the outer perianth leaves; the upper leaf or
bract has a tendency to become petaloid.&nbsp; If the anthers are pulled,
the filaments are separated from them and remain as subulate white pointed
processes.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;Labiata, Ocymoidea, Salvia! erect, ramose, foliis
rugosis, verticillatis; spicatis racemosis.&nbsp; <i>Cal</i>. bilabiata
supra planisculis, medio carinatus, <i>Cor</i>. pallida, c&aelig;rulea,
bilabiata, labio superiora subfornicata: lateralibus subrevolutis.&nbsp;
See Catalogue No. 52, in fields Chugur Pair, common on grassy banks.</p>
<p>A curious tendency is observed in Pomace&aelig;, Cerase&aelig; to
have the stamina of the same colour as the petals, thereby <i>showing</i>
<i>their</i> <i>origin</i>?&nbsp; How is it explained that in some transformations
of this, the anthers alone are petaliformed, while in others both filament
and anther are equally and primarily affected.</p>
<p>The female Lophophorus has been living on nothing for at least a
week; its voice is various, sometimes not unlike that of a large hawk,
at others a cackle, or low chuckle; occasionally it runs forward, erecting
its crest, and spreading out its tail like a fan, the <i>tail</i> <i>being</i>
<i>depressed</i>.&nbsp; I fancy it roosts in trees not unlike certain
pigeons, H&aelig;matornis one species come in, this genus I think represents
Parus: it has the same fluttering clinging habits, it often sallies
forth like Merops after insects, the genus is remarkable for the yellow
or red colour of the under tail-covers, it is a noisy bird, and not
wary until so taught by experience.&nbsp; I doubt its power of singing.&nbsp;
The so called Bulbul, <i>hazari</i> <i>dastar</i>, the famous songster,
is not a real <i>bulbul</i>, but either Alaudina or a stonechat.</p>
<p>With H&aelig;matornis has appeared a fine Merops, of which I have
not yet got a specimen; its habits were quite those of Merops, and it
made the same noise: it occurred with H&aelig;matornis.</p>
<p>Chugur is a large extent of ruins, traces of paths are visible leading
to the houses, mere huts built of slabs of slate.&nbsp; There is one
square part remaining much like the base of one of the topes to which
it assimilates; the building, is of slabs of wood and stone, intervening.&nbsp;
What could have induced the Mussulmans to build on such horridly hard
barren and hot places, with no water near? or did they occupy places
taken from the <i>Kafirs</i>.&nbsp; The latter I should think most likely
from the names, which are evidently <i>Kafir</i>.</p>
<p><i>20th</i>.&mdash;The bird alluded to yesterday, was again seen
to-day.&nbsp; I remember shooting the same species at elevations of
8,000 feet in Bootan, in oak forests.&nbsp; It has the habits of Merops,
with its voice or chirp, and is very gregarious, so that one part of
the flock will not separate from the rest.&nbsp; It perches in a very
erect manner making swoops and sallies after insects precisely as Merops.&nbsp;
Plumage sombre, general colour slaty, quills and crest blackish, bill
and feet orange, tail forked.</p>
<p>Is this bird of the sub-family Brachypodin&aelig;, or is it a Fissirostral
bird; the wings, although graduated as to the two first quills (the
first being half spurious) are still long, and may be called pointed.&nbsp;
It obviously has much analogy? with the Drongo shrikes in habits, and
in forked tail: as well as in lengthened body?&nbsp; Both it and H&aelig;matornes
are very local, none being found here but just around a village called
Pillipote, a favourite station&mdash;Zaitoon trees, or naked Bakkeins.&nbsp;
H&aelig;matornis I have seen feeding on the ground, this species has
the same voice as that of the genus generally.</p>
<p>The yellowish <i>Bunting</i>-<i>like</i> water-wagtail, is very common
just now: it occurs in wheat fields; flight, chirp, and mode of getting
up when disturbed just as in the Buntings.</p>
<p>Weather very unsettled, heavy rain and thunder last night, and now
threatening a gale.</p>
<p><i>21st</i>.&mdash;Returned towards Pushut: a Lanius, but not the
one shot, was seen near the road in bushes.</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Of the four red-billed Shrikes, two are male and
female, sexes alike, stomach fleshy like that of H&aelig;matornis, but
food entirely vegetable: the two female stomachs contained each a seed
of the <i>Bukkein</i> (Melia): the two males contained fragments of
buds, perhaps of a willow, but not a vestige of an insect, so their
swooping and sallying is a mere analogical representation of Merops.&nbsp;
In H&aelig;matornis contents of stomach chiefly vegetable, partly of
insects.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;Very rainy and unsettled weather, thunder and
lightning.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;-Clearing up: heavy rain in some parts of the
night, otherwise fine.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;A beautiful morning.&nbsp; Went to Kooner, distance
twelve to thirteen miles: for three miles the road was dangerous but
tolerably decent, no defiles being passed, in which murderers were likely
to lurk, very little difference in seasons between this and Pushut.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;Returned again to Pushut.&nbsp; The country about
Pushut is one sheet of cultivation, studded with trees; so thick are
these that few villages are discernible in consequence.&nbsp; Nothing
particularly notable occurred, except that a tulip is common in the
fields about Kooner, but not found in those about Pushut: it occurs
also with Amaryllide&aelig;, which is likewise a stranger to Pushut.&nbsp;
What is the reason of the ruined forts so common in this country?&nbsp;
One would think that it were useless to pull down or destroy a good
fort, when it is the intention of building another, so that they are
scarcely to be accounted for from a succession of conquerors.</p>
<p>The country has, and always will be, a distracted one.&nbsp; I observe
that in all parts approaching mountains, in which the chief danger of
robbery exists, that there are generally people and especially boys
tending cattle, so that they must probably be familiar with robberies
and murders, and seeing these done so openly, so easily, and so securely,
they may well be imagined to become ready scholars.&nbsp; So even if
the stock already existing in the robbers&rsquo; sons, etc., were deficient,
others would be found ready to take up the profession.&nbsp; The Kooner
Dhurrah, or valley, is a very fine one, it is a good instance of the
peculiar kind of slope or <i>talus</i>, so common in this country.&nbsp;
The soil in such places being so stony as to be useless for cultivation.&nbsp;
Low parts entering into the valley become useful for wheat, that is,
if rain falls early, these Dhurrahs are formed or filled by debris from
the surrounding hills, carried down by torrents, which are constantly
changing their beds, the outline of the edge is circular, such as that
of a sand bank at the mouth of a river, the finer particles being of
course carried furthest down.</p>
<p>The Kooner valley may be considered as the second; the Shaiwa distinct
forming the first; it continues as far as the bend to Chugur Pair; its
beginning is close to Kooner village, near the ferry where the valley
is much contracted.</p>
<p><i>31st</i>.&mdash;The beautiful Smyrna kingfisher of India, with
metallic plumage, chocolate-brown underneath, occurs at Kooner.</p>
<p>The common kite is very expert in seizing objects with its claws
while flying: as is the Pondicherry falcon.&nbsp; They are often seen
about standing water, fishing I fancy with their claws for shells, etc.
on the surface.</p>
<p>The late rain has caused a torrent down Dhurrah Bader, and the fields
and low grounds about Choke have been inundated; about these spots,
birds have collected in numbers, the common crow taking advantage of
the circumstance had turned as it were, kingfisher, swooping about like
the kite.&nbsp; There were two species of Larid&aelig;, neither of which
I had seen before, several small Tring&aelig;, the very long red shanked
bird, Hematopus? the metallic Tantalus, common, jack-snipe, and hosts
of Budytes, which were busily employed flying and flitting about after
insects.&nbsp; Edolius occurs at Kooner as well as here.&nbsp; The number
of birds is small certainly, although the trees, etc. are now in full
leaf: no new birds seem to have come in, except the dove, and Edolius;
neither H&aelig;matornis nor Brachypus yet observed, one or two fresh
species of Alaudina, and stonechats have made their appearance.&nbsp;
It is curious that the larks do not remain above a few days, none are
to be seen now, that the crops are barely a foot high.</p>
<p>The female Monaul is going on well, though obliged to be crammed,
for though it takes water voluntarily it will not take food.&nbsp; It
is a very domestic bird, and fond of notice, its voice on such occasions
is pleasing, on some others very harsh and hawk or eagle-like.&nbsp;
Its manners are curious, depressing its tail, and arching its neck,
and pecking at imaginary objects in a curious way.&nbsp; From the expressive
manner in which it looks up at sunset on surrounding objects, especially
trees, it is obviously accustomed to roost.</p>
<p><i>April</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Pushut Fort.</p>
<p><i>4th</i>.&mdash;Weather unsettled: a slight rumbling sound of an
earthquake was felt yesterday evening, the atmosphere at the time being
very close: this was succeeded by a squall.&nbsp; Strong winds are prevalent,
generally easterly: clear sunshine is evidently of rare continuance
at Pushut: little snow remains except towards Bharawul.</p>
<p>I was much struck this morning with the entire disappearance of a
green mantle of Confervoid scum from the surface of a foul pool close
to my quarters.&nbsp; Yesterday the pool was quite green, now there
is no green, nor any traces of the scum except such portion as was not
in the water but round the margins.</p>
<p><i>6th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Chugur-Serai, which place was reached
after marching 3 h. 10 m. at three miles an hour.&nbsp; Ocharrye one
of the peaks near this is deep in snow; it is much higher than Speencas.&nbsp;
The season here is now nearly as forward as it is at Kooner, although
on my last visit sixteen days ago, it was fifteen days behind, but the
narrowness of the valley must increase the heat much.</p>
<p>Great delay occurred in crossing the Pushut river, which is much
swollen from the heavy rain on the 4th.&nbsp; Thunder and hailstone
common, clear days decidedly rare in the spring of these parts.</p>
<p>Edolius occurs here, another stonechat has come in.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Otipore, which took 8 h. 9 m. to perform
the journey; very unsettled weather.&nbsp; Yesterday several thunderstorms,
and heavy rain.</p>
<p><i>10th</i>.&mdash;Clearing up, went to Bharawul; and returned on
the 12th.&nbsp; I was much disappointed at the paucity of forms, for
I did not get ten species, not met with before.&nbsp; The flora of the
fir woods amounts to almost nothing, Colchicum straggles up now and
then, this and a grass or Carex, a Caprifoliaceous shrub, and Cotoneaster
of Tazeen, and Fragaria are the only forms.&nbsp; The oak as it gets
to higher altitudes assumes a different form, probably it is a different
species, for the leaves are much less coriaceous, and are not glaucous
underneath, otherwise there is little difference between it and the
common Baloot, the chief plants found occurred in the clearings, which
surround Bharawul to some extent.&nbsp; Alliaria is very common; also
Tulipa.&nbsp; In this variety the dehiscence of the anthers continues
until, from a single simple pore, a line reaching nearly the whole length
of the anther is formed: a very pretty and sweet smelling Anemone common,
Viola, Rumex, Thalictrum a rather fine species, Hedera, Rubia cordifolia,
Valeriana, Corydalis, Fragaria, Thlaspidea, Sambucus, Ebulus adonis,
Berberis, Equisetum, Clematis, Urtica urens, were noticed, either in
cultivation or on the edge of the clearings.&nbsp; Poor as the flora
is, I see no chance of its promising much variety, for I observe few
other plants showing themselves: several ferns were met with in moist
places, and under rocks, two Asplenia, one undetermined; Aspidioides
very common in some places, but of last year.</p>
<p>The soil is deepish and good, when wet it is subtenacious.&nbsp;
The <i>Nukhtur</i> is a large tree, seventy to eighty feet high; one
of an average size measured fourteen feet in girth, four feet from the
base.&nbsp; The slopes of the mountain are steep, and the ravines very
rocky: on the ridges between these, the ground is covered with soil.&nbsp;
Colchicum observed as high as 7,500 feet.&nbsp; I returned another way,
keeping along the large ravine that drains the mountain to the north,
and which falls into the Otipore river, below Shinegam.</p>
<p>Buddlea was noticed at 5,800 feet, Hyacinthus throughout from this
to Bharawul; <i>Nurgiss</i> 5,800 feet, Impatiens the same as the species
below 5,000, Myrsinea ditto, Fraxinus is very common about 4,000 feet,
it is very easily mistaken for the Xanthoxylon, which appears common
over most parts of Khorassan.&nbsp; The range of the Cytisus, which
is a beautiful sweet smelling shrub, is extensive, it may be included
here between 3,000 and 7,000 feet: associated with it between 4,000
to 4,500 feet is a Caragana, and about this occurs a fine Salveoideo-Dracocephalum.</p>
<p>The limit of the Baloot may be taken at 4,000 feet, but in sheltered
ravines it descends lower.</p>
<p>Euonymus <i>Moamunna</i>, Periplocea, scarcely extend above 4,000
feet, neither do the spirescent Astragali, these are succeeded by two
or three espinous species, one the same as the Astragalus stipulis magnis
of the river towards Pironi.&nbsp; Amygdalus ranges between 3,500 and
7,000 feet, the pretty Cerasus does not extend above 4,000 feet.&nbsp;
There appears to be another Amygdalus above.</p>
<p>The chief vegetation of the mountain below 6,000 feet appears to
be a tufted coarse Andropogoneous grass, and in such situations as this
occupies, little soil is to be found; the Baloot, and Zaitoon, are confined
to sheltered places.&nbsp; Above they occur indiscriminately on all
faces, but Zaitoon is rare at such elevations; few birds were observed,
the most common about Bharawul are an Emberizoid and a Certhia?&nbsp;
Muscicapa flammea was seen at 7,000 feet in pine forests with several
Sitt&aelig;: in these forests and about Bharawul, only one Garrulus
was heard, and few woodpigeons were seen.&nbsp; The Picus is still common,
Myophorus now extends up to Bharawul.&nbsp; Parus c&aelig;ruleus still
continues.&nbsp; Another female Nemorrh&aelig;dus is brought in with
young: the breeding time probably takes place two months later.&nbsp;
The Merula before found below, now occurs in flocks about Bharawul.</p>
<p>According to the natives there is only about twenty days difference
in the seasons of cutting wheat and barley; this is probably not true,
yet it is borne out by the Tulip, Cytisus and Hyacinth.</p>
<p>The village has been founded five years since, and contains 180 souls.&nbsp;
The burial ground contains sixteen graves, which will give the annual
percentage of mortality.&nbsp; At Otipore the mortality is said to be
great.&nbsp; Whence do these people get their curious grey eyes, and
light hair?</p>
<p>Daphne extends to Bharawul.</p>
<p><i>14th</i>.&mdash;The kingcrow is now in here, also Columba, and
Lanius; this last has an unceasing jarring chirp, it has however considerable
powers of voice.</p>
<p>Sitta feeds on seeds as well as on insects, but the structure of
its stomach is insectivorous.</p>
<p>The female Monaul died yesterday.&nbsp; I heard some of these birds
in the pine forests of Bharawul, their voice being very loud and grating;
the female was a good tempered bird, capable of attachment, when caressed
its notes were pleasing.</p>
<p><i>15th</i>.&mdash;The Hoopoe seen; another fish brought in to-day,
the usual mountainous form, but with a very rough nose.</p>
<p>The Edolius is here the earliest and the latest daily bird.&nbsp;
I observed several to-day on a tree making a great noise with their
harsh chirp, at each chirp the tail was for the instant jerked out like
a fan.</p>
<p><i>17th</i>.&mdash;A single parrot seen flying overhead.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;What is the bodily strength of man to that of
insects!&nbsp; I have just been watching an ant dragging the body of
a hornet, many times larger than itself, up a door with the greatest
ease; so much so, that after dragging it up three feet, it came down
to alter its position, carrying it up a second time by its wing: the
ant was of a large species.</p>
<p><i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Pastor came in to-day, an elegant bird, eyes nearly
white, tinged with grey; legs and beak yellow, base of gape leaden-blue,
junction of yellow and blue parts greenish!</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;Mango bird first seen today, another dove came
in about the 23rd.&nbsp; Quail coming in, Pastor roseus.</p>
<p>Every plant from the Kafir hills convinces me that they are Himalayan
in their features, and that about this the transition between the American
and genuine European forms takes place.&nbsp; Thus I have seen Asperula,
two and three European looking Ranunculi.</p>
<p>Crat&oelig;gus, etc. in addition to the other forms, before alluded
to.</p>
<p>There is a rather fine <i>sissoo</i> near Sheargar, it is curious
that it is later in coming into leaf than any other tree.&nbsp; Does
this indicate its being of a more tropical nature than the others? on
the contrary, the Bukkeim is now in flower, also Citrus.</p>
<p>The Affghans are fond of Amaryllide&aelig;, <i>Gratool</i>, <i>Goolab</i>,
and Lonicera, in the season of the two former, every one met has a bunch
placed over each ear.</p>
<p>Observed to-day a curious monstrosity of the ovula of the Lonicera
of this place, from which it is evident, that the ovule represents a
bud; the funicle the <i>stalk</i>; the teguments convolute leaves, and
the nucleus the punctum of growth.</p>
<p>Every variation was observed, generally the more leafy the outer
tegument the greater was the degree of straightness of the funicle,
and the abortion of the nucleus.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;To Chugur-Serai.</p>
<p><i>June</i> <i>5th</i>.&mdash;Arrived at Cabul.</p>
<p>The whole country between Khuggur and Koord Cabul, even including
the high ground of this, or Huft-Kotul, presents the same formation,
but from Khuggur it rises gradually, and beyond Gundamuck loses all
characters of tabularity, it consists of sand, overlying which is a
bed of blocks or often of boulders; in this sand, which is here and
there easily pulverised, (in other places it is pressed as it were into
slabs of no great thickness;) layers or beds of conglomerate frequently
occur, either regularly or irregularly; in one case two conglomerated
beds approached at an angle and then united.</p>
<p>The framework or base of the country is generally limestone, sometimes
slate which presents every variety of distortion, the strata being often
vertical and wavy, no dykes were observed.&nbsp; The older rocks are
generally completely covered by sand and shingle, or stones; but as
we approach the boundaries of the valleys, they protrude into ridges,
often of considerable size and height.&nbsp; The valleys however are
not entirely bounded by these to the west, for as I have said, the plain
of Koord Cabul is reached by crossing undulations of this same formation.&nbsp;
From Khuggur to Gundamuck, about five stony steppes are crossed, each
rising in height above the last, and each separated by deep ravines,
with one or both banks generally precipitous, affording exit to streamlets
from the Sofaid-Koh.&nbsp; It is curious that the streamlets, and streams
about Gundamuck have not worn themselves half as deep channels as those
about Khuggur, although no appreciable difference is apparent in the
strata.</p>
<p>The surface is often rendered rugged in places by the occurrence
of loose slabs, which give the appearance of stratification to the rocks.</p>
<p>It appears to me that the whole of the extreme eastern Khorassan
originally was a bed of stones or boulders, overlying a formation of
pure sand, and that its irregular surface is due to the subsequent upheavement
of the foundation ridges.&nbsp; The good soil is in such case necessarily
confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the streams, etc. descending
from those ridges.</p>
<p>The following is a section exposed on the north boundary of the valley,
not far from Jugdulluck:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m476.jpg">
<img alt="Section of valley near Jugdulluck" src="images/m476.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The whole tract is devoid of trees, until one nears Jugdulluck, when
not only the foundation rocks, but also the stony undulated hills are
dotted with stunted trees of Baloot and Xanthoxylon.&nbsp; Tufted Andropogoneous
grasses form the prevailing feature, &AElig;rua also is common along
the streams: and wherever the ground retains moisture, Typha latifolia
abounds with the usual frequenters of watery spots.&nbsp; The road to
Gundamuck, especially the ascent of the two last steppes, is infamous;
but the regular Jallalabad road is good, having only one descent to
Neemla, and an easy ascent from that place, and thence it is over a
gentle declivity to Futtehabad.</p>
<p>The spurs from the Sofaid-Koh are very numerous, and the ravines
they form show the great quantity of water derived from this ridge,
their direction is N. 45, E.&nbsp; The direction of the streams after
emerging from the lower ridges continues about the same.</p>
<p>The Cabul and Soorkhab rivers debouche at a much greater angle.&nbsp;
Their direction being 95, E.&nbsp; The waters of both are turbid, but
those of the latter are reddish.</p>
<p>Throughout the valley of Jallalabad cultivation extends alone along
the streams, many of which are entirely consumed by agricultural processes;
in no place does it bear any proportion to the uncultivated portion,
which is invariably densely strewed with stones, the smaller of which
are generally water-worn; the larger, masses of angular rock.</p>
<p>White mulberries ripen in perfection at Gundamuck in the early part
of July.&nbsp; There is more cultivation about Khuggur occurring in
a continuous and broadish tract, than in almost any other place.</p>
<p>I observed a curious tendency to anastomosis, or self-grafting in
the roots of Morus: this in its young state often has pinnatifid artacarpoid
leaves.&nbsp; Query, is this a sign of the greater development of Morus?
or is it in any way analogous to that progressive development existing
during the growth of every animated being?</p>
<p>At Gundamuck observed Oriolus; it differs in plumage and voice from
the Indian Mango bird, which is a far more beautiful bird, with only
one note: Edolius also seen.</p>
<p>Pastor and the other common birds.&nbsp; Merops was seen soaring
over stones, and stooping at insects; in such situations it remains
long on the wing; it does not appear to perch on any thing but withered
branches.</p>
<p>Composita Senecionoides occurs about Soorkhab, Reaumuria occurs half-way
between it and Gundamuck.&nbsp; Capparis continues to Soorkhab.&nbsp;
Statices common, also Campanula; and about Jugdulluck a striking Boragineous
plant, Boragini&aelig; sp., and on the sandy pass above Barkhab, a Salvia
is found in profusion, one of the commonest grasses is Poa <i>cynosuroides</i>?</p>
<p>The stem of Hippuris is worth examination, inasmuch as it consists
of a central easily separable axis, and a vertical system of great thickness,
highly cellular, so that judging <i>a</i> <i>priori</i>, as these cells
(which are compound) occupy the whole space between the ligneous system
and the cutis, no longitudinal vessels can exist in that part which
represents the bark.</p>
<p><i>15th</i>.&mdash;Cabul.&nbsp; Glycyrrhiza thermopsoides frequently
presents on the non-flowering stems, a pod-like transformation of the
uppermost leaves.</p>
<p>In Centaurea <i>cyanea</i>, the disposition of the limb of the ray
is such that the incomplete part or the fissure is outside.&nbsp; This
is exactly opposite to the disposition of the same part in true Ligulat&aelig;.</p>
<p>Judging from Centaurea, the smaller lip of the bilabiate species
of Composit&aelig; ought to be situated outside.</p>
<p>Erythr&aelig;oides, Glauca floribus albidis occurs on the <i>Chummums</i>.</p>
<p><i>16th</i>.&mdash;Regaled with a library: &ldquo;Calumny and detraction,&rdquo;
says Boerhaave, &ldquo;are sparks, which if you do not blow them, will
go out of themselves.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Murphy&rsquo;s</i> <i>Johnston</i>,
Vol. IX. p.34.</p>
<p>In Johnston&rsquo;s Life of Drake, p.99 to 100, are some admirable
remarks on those minds, that disapprove of every strikingly novel scheme,
and from which a good motto might be chosen, should any national system
be proposed in Botany.</p>
<p>What were Sir Thomas Browne&rsquo;s five sorts of vegetables, and
what were his remarks on the form of plants and laws of vegetation?&mdash;<i>See</i>
<i>Johnston&rsquo;s</i> <i>Works</i>, Vol. IX.&nbsp; p.296.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>
<p><i>From</i> <i>Cabul</i> <i>to</i> <i>Kohi</i>-<i>Baba</i>.</p>
<p><i>July</i> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded from Cabul to Shah Bagh;
cloudy weather, occasionally a very slight shower during the last few
days, depending probably on the Punjab rains.&nbsp; To-day, observed
a small green caterpillar, climbing up a fine thread, like a spider&rsquo;s
web, which hung from the fly of the tent; its motions were precisely
those of climbing, the thread over which it had passed was accumulated
between its third pairs of legs; it did not use its mouth.</p>
<p>I did not ascertain whether the thread was its own production or
not; if it was, it must have come out of its tail.</p>
<p><i>24th</i>.&mdash;The fish in the Cabul river here are, a Loach,
an Oreinus, and a Barbel; none of these grow to any size, as there is
but little water left in the river in consequence of the drain for extensive
cultivation on both the east and west sides of the city.</p>
<p>Small specimens of these fish, especially the Loach and Oreinus,
are found in the canals or larger watercuts, in which the current is
slow and regular.&nbsp; It is curious that in the canal near the Shah
Bagh, which has been lately turned off above the Cantonment, all the
specimens of the Loach left in the pools of water were dead, while the
Oreinus did not appear to have suffered.</p>
<p>This Loach is a Cobitis propria, it has the usual form of that genus,
the spots are disposed irregularly, rarely becoming banded.&nbsp; The
shape of the head is curious, the forehead being prominent, this gives
the mouth an appearance of unusual depression. <a name="citation479"></a><a href="#footnote479">{479}</a></p>
<p>The country both on the east and west sides of Cabul may have been
formerly a lake.&nbsp; Such indeed would seem to have been the origin
of all the valleys in which there is an expanse of tillable ground,
and not mere strips confined to the banks of the draining streams.</p>
<p>The eastern valley is indeed partly occupied by the large sheet of
water to the north, and the west is very marshy.&nbsp; The eastern one
is interspersed with low detached ranges of hills.</p>
<p>The birds are a magpie, a dove, Oriolus, Pastor roseus, Pastor alter,
sparrow, water-wagtail, Hirundo, Hoopoe, Lanius, Sylvia sp., water-hen,
wild ducks on the lake, and Merops; almost all these as at Khujgal,
but no <i>minas</i>, or Edolia.</p>
<p>At Urghundy occurs Potentilla quinquifolia, repens radicans pubescens,
stipulis oblongis.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;Halted at Koti-Ashruf.&nbsp; The most common plants
on the Khak-i-Sofaid pass are two or three of the small pulvinate Statices,
Senecionoides glaucescens.&nbsp; The yellow Asphodelus is very common,
and I also saw A. mesembryanthemifolia.&nbsp; At the foot of the pass,
I saw Scabiosa, which also occurred on the summit.</p>
<p>First march on the Cabul side of Ghuznee.&nbsp; Whole tracts blue
with the Labiata Plectranthoides; at Urghundy, along a watercut, are
planted several willows of the common large-leaved kind, the bark of
these on all the older parts is cracked longitudinally, and the trunk
has the appearance of being twisted, which I have no doubt is the natural
state, the spire is from left to right.&nbsp; The prevailing winds are
easterly.</p>
<p>Bean cultivation is very common in the valley of the Cabul river
to the west beyond the Khak-i-Sofaid pass; I suspect it requires a greater
altitude than most of the other cultivated plants of Affghanistan, it
abounds in the high ground about Shaikhabad.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded in the morning from Julraize to Sir-i-Chushme.&nbsp;
The fish of the place are the same, the Silurus being common.&nbsp;
The two sorts of Oreinus vary much in the length of the intestinal canal,&mdash;the
yellowish and large one having it five times: the small and less yellowish,
three and a half lengths of the body.&nbsp; Both these species come
close to Barbus, showing that the spinosity of the dorsal fin is a more
valuable character than that of the form of the mouth.</p>
<p>The cartilaginous disc of Oreinus is a reflection outwards of the
osseo-cartilaginous part of the mouth, the fleshy part alone is the
lips.&nbsp; Oriolus, Upupa, and Percnopterus, continue with Columba.&nbsp;
Grapes and apricots <i>khar</i> <i>see</i>, and the common ones reach
as far as this, but are very inferior to those of Cabul; rice cultivated
here and there.&nbsp; The chief trees are Populus lombardensis, Salix
magnifolia, and S. pendula, Hippoph&aelig;.</p>
<p>At Koti-Ashruf Salix angustissima is found, and on it Cuscuta gigantea;
on to-day&rsquo;s march Hippoph&aelig;, but this is found also at Maidan:
Merops was heard at Koti-Ashruf.&nbsp; In the spring of Sir-i-Chushme,
a Typhoid plant occurs in profusion, Veronic&aelig; 2, alta et repens
rotundifolia, Nasturtium aquatica, Scrophularia of Julraize, Juncus,
Triglochin, and Plantago of the green sward, everywhere between 6,000
and 11,000 feet.</p>
<p>Trees end at the foot of Oonnye.</p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;Girdun Dewar.&nbsp; Salvia swarms up the ascent
and on the descent, but less so than before, and on the Yonutt platform
it is almost absent; Cnicus also in profusion both up and down, and
on the platform Festuca triticoides begins about half-way up; Statice
are common over the whole pass.&nbsp; Caragana in the grassy swardy
ravines.&nbsp; On the highest point Astragalus arbuscula, the fields
studded with yellow buttons of tansy, and white flowers of Stellaria;
Arabidea glauca siliculosa, also common; this is rare on the west side
of Hindoo-koosh, as is also Stellaria.&nbsp; Tansy continues in some
places.</p>
<p><i>31st</i>.&mdash;To Kurzar.&nbsp; Proceeded up the Siah-Sung; along
the river, green sward with patches of Caragana, Campanula, and Geraniums
occurred in profusion in some places.&nbsp; Salvia not uncommon; at
the first part, or perhaps for three miles from camp a large Hingoid
is common, smaller and whiter than the species so common on the lower
hills, and which is the large-leaved species of Quettah and the Kojhuk
pass.&nbsp; Potamogeton cylindrifolia common; Senecionoides.</p>
<p>On the stony part, or beyond Siah-Sung, when one leaves the bed of
the river, Astragali two or three species, Salvia, and Blitum.&nbsp;
Two sorts of fish are found in the river, and perhaps a third in the
black hammer-headed Silurus. <a name="citation481"></a><a href="#footnote481">{481}</a>&nbsp;
Of the two caught, one is an Oreinus, but passing close into Barbus.&nbsp;
Beneath the glandular line, white, above fuscous-brownish, with irregular
black spots, fins fusco-reddish.</p>
<p>The other is a loach, Cobitis propria, shape shark-like, colour yellowish-brown,
almost tawny, sides irregularly spotted with brownish-black spots, arranged
on the back in broad irregular, generally complete bands.&nbsp; Head
not banded, fins tawny, with oblong black spots, eyes prominent, irides
reddish-orange: this is a very abundant species.</p>
<p>Poplar trees, (P. lombardensis): these from being planted close,
grow together, the union generally taking place near the base.&nbsp;
I have not seen a section of the wood.</p>
<p><i>August</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Kaloo.&nbsp; So far as I can judge,
the flora of this side of the pass does not differ, but in a few unimportant
instances from that of the Kurzar side.&nbsp; The summit however has
a much colder climate, probably from being exposed on the Kurzar side
to an extremely cold and piercing wind from the Kohi-Baba range.&nbsp;
Cnici 2, and Festuca triticoides are the most common plants, with Arenaria
fruticosa, Composita No. 152, Asphodelus of Erak now nearly passed flower,
and some Astragali.&nbsp; But on this side, Cnici cease almost entirely,
although they re-appear lower down, but only partially, and the top
of the pass is covered with the Statice of Kurzar, and Astragali, among
which, that with the flat pod, winged on the dorsal suture, is the most
common.&nbsp; Lower down the same, or similar features continue, and
the only plants limited to this side are a curious Astragalus, Crotalarioid,
Polygonum fruticosa, microphyllum, and spinosum, a Boraginea like that
of Jugdulluck, but much smaller and decumbent, a Papaverace&aelig;,
petalis Papaveris Rh&oelig;adis, with a siliquose fruit, and Clematis
erecta: willow trees (the broad leaved species) occur here, a large
Agrostic grass, Ribes and Symphorema of Erak.</p>
<p>The Affghans appear to cut every plant almost of any size for winter
fodder, even thistles, docks, etc.&nbsp; The purple Lactucoid of Cabul
re-appears, and the curious flat fruit calyxed Boraginea of Shawl both
in abundance.&nbsp; The crops here are not more forward than those at
Kurzar; the fields are <i>crowded</i> with Stellaria, but there is much
less Tanacetum; Geraniums occur in profusion.</p>
<p>Silene fimbriata, is a night flower, withering by 9 A.M.</p>
<p>I found no snow up the left Hajeeguk ravine, and the effect was marked,
namely, that none of the alpine plants are so abundant about it as last
season, when they were in flower, or had passed.</p>
<p>There is on the hills about this ravine, a large burrowing animal,
probably a marmot; it is of a dark colour with tawny rump; when on the
alert it sits on its rump, or rather perhaps raised on the hind legs,
and has the voice of an ordinary Rodentia.</p>
<p>I heard several of these, but saw only one.</p>
<p>Rich botanising is to be had on the swampy ground at the mouth of
the right ravine.&nbsp; Pediculares 2, Silenace&aelig; 3 or 4, Veronice&aelig;
2, Orchis 1, Ranunculi 2, Junci 2, Carices several, Swerti&aelig; 2,
one the larger Solidago, Geranium, Gramine&aelig; several, Parnassia
of Erak, Campanula, Ruta odora, etc.</p>
<p><i>3rd</i>.&mdash;To Topehee.&nbsp; The vegetation of Kaloo is far
less varied than that of Hajeeguk, for it presents no such swampy ravines
at such elevations.</p>
<p>The plants of the hills around Kaloo villages continue half-way up,
on the road over the ravine Corvisartia is plentiful, with a Labiata,
Calyce Royle&aelig;, in profusion; this and Cnici form the chief vegetation;
Papaverace&aelig; also continue.</p>
<p>Up the 1st ascent Hingoid tenuifolia, Ephedra stricta, Ribes commence,
Ephedra continuing throughout wherever the bare rocks project through
the loose soil; one-third way up, Statice long and short-peduncled commence
with an Astragalus.&nbsp; The bulk of the vegetation is an Artemisia;
Royleoid and Chenopodium villosum continue, and do so for half-way up.</p>
<p>At the black rock half-way up, Dianthus, Astragalus, Crotalarioid,
Ros&aelig; sp., Statice pulvinata, are common, this last and Artemisia
are the chief features: Scutellaria, Stellaria dichotoma, Umbellifera
of Yonutt, Corvisartia, wild Gramine&aelig; of Yonutt, Arenaria fruticosa,
Festuca triticoides continues.&nbsp; Borago of upper Kaloo, and the
Glauci of Kaloo occur.&nbsp; Astragali 2 or 3 sp., Silene sp., but the
chief vegetation is Artemisia.</p>
<p>On the summit, Corvisartia, Boragine&aelig;, Gramine&aelig;, several;
a straggling Plectranthus c&oelig;ruleus, Arenaria fruticosa, Allium
rubrum, Cnici 2, the yellow Erigeronoid of Hajeeguk summit, occur on
the descent just below the ridge, and on this side the Statice pulvinata
is in profusion, and of large size.&nbsp; Large marmot, with teeth like
those of a rat.</p>
<p><i>4th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Bamean.&nbsp; At Topehee was found
a curious succulent Hypericum, it is odd that the leaves, etc. of these
succulent saline plants are cold; strikingly so.&nbsp; Connected with
this low temperature, is the fact, that if shut up in a box with other
plants, and water thrown in, that even though they be at the top, they
cause the deposit of all the water that passes up in the shape of vapour,
while the ordinary plants remain quite dry!&nbsp; A wonderful provision
of nature adapting them the more to extremely dry stations.&nbsp; About
Topehee, Cichorium is common; Salvia of Oonnye, Geranium, Artemisia
exaltata of Sir-i-Chushme, and Pulmonaria, so common everywhere, occur;
Glaucum swarms in saline marshy places.&nbsp; Triglochin is also found,
also Ranunculus stolonifer&aelig; trilobata of Kaloo, Hippuris.&nbsp;
The flat-calyxed Boraginea, Melilotus officinalis also found; Potamogeton
cylindrifolia, Centaurea lutea.</p>
<p>There also occurs along the barren slopes of the hills a glaucous
shrub, much like that between Chunni and Dund-i-Goolai, decumbens, subspinos:
glauco alb. fruct. baccato drupaceis, oblongis, purpuris, basi calyce
parvo, 5-fido, stylo brevi apiculatis, putamina osseo-crasso oblongo
ovato, Sem. immatur.</p>
<p><i>8th</i>.&mdash;Bamean.&nbsp; The fish, so far as I have caught
any, seem to be one trout, and two barbels.&nbsp; Of 5 species, one
of these takes the worm greedily, the length of the intestines varied
in every instance, and of three the relative lengths of body and canal
were as follows:</p>
<pre>Inches.     Canal.

Body 6      (times   ) 2.125 ( Of three since captured and
Body 7      (longer  ) 2&frac12;    ( about 8 inches long, all
Body 10&frac12;    (than the) 3&frac12;    ( nearly the same size, the
            (body.   )       ( length of the canal was
                             ( three times longer than the
                             ( body.</pre>
<p>The intestines as usual taper almost gradually from the stomach and
&oelig;sophagus, and are gorged with greenish pulp.</p>
<p>This is worth following up.&nbsp; It is scarcely credible, but that
the species are really different; or if not, the variety in the length
will considerably diminish the value of the length of canal as a principle
of arrangement. <a name="citation484"></a><a href="#footnote484">{484}</a></p>
<p>The glaucous long-peduncled, large-flowered Statice is limited to
the east side of Kaloo.&nbsp; On this side another species occupies
similar elevations, viz., 9,500 to 10,500 feet; it is a good deal like
the one met with towards Ghuzni.&nbsp; These species are less alpine
than the short-peduncled species with large flowers, which continues
all over Kaloo, being in great perfection on the west side, near the
summit.&nbsp; Another short-peduncled species appears on the descent,
close to upper Topehee.&nbsp; Towards this Royleoid occurs but sparingly,
and the first change takes place in the abundance of Salicornia or Kochia.&nbsp;
Also about this, Peganum and Salvia reoccur, both kinds not being uncommon
about Bamean.</p>
<p>Lactuca dislocata occurs throughout.</p>
<p>The vegetation of Bamean is that of Topehee, but the small flowered
Tamarisk is scarce&mdash;Potentilla anserina is common, Hyoscyamus spinosus
of Kaloo occurs.</p>
<p>The Bamean river divides the Kohi-Baba from the Hindoo-koosh, but
both are obviously of the same system, i.e. they divide the ranges to
the north.&nbsp; To the east their offsets are divided by the Kaloo
river.&nbsp; The direction of the Hindoo-koosh and that of the Kohi-Baba,
is about 115 west.&nbsp; The space to the west consists of a low, rather
flat plateau, (as it appears from the top of Kaloo,) this flat belongs
to the Kohi-Baba range; the offsets of the Hindoo-koosh to the east
and north are ordinarily shaped.&nbsp; All the hills on the north side
of the valley disintegrate on their south faces, forming cliffs of partial
extent.</p>
<p><i>13th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Akrobat, ascending the Bamean river,
and then diverging up a <i>kotul</i> or acclivity of considerable height,
but gradual ascent.&nbsp; Then descending at once steeply to Akrobat,
which is about 9,500 feet above the sea.&nbsp; Along the river, Rosa,
Hippoph&aelig;, and Salix occur, the two former being abundant.&nbsp;
Scarcely any change in vegetation occurs: an Ephedra, very common up
the <i>kotul</i> and abundantly in fruit.&nbsp; The hills are very barren,
and nothing remarkable is observable about Syghan.&nbsp; Apricot constitutes
the only fruit tree.&nbsp; Salix, Populus, and Sinjit occur.</p>
<p>All the valleys are narrow, and the hills very barren, the chief
vegetation being Salsolace&aelig;.&nbsp; The vegetation of the valleys
is the same as that of Bamean; on the north of Akrobat two Statice occur,
one with spathulate leaves scapigerous, the other a tall straggling
plant.</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;Erak.&nbsp; The vegetation of Kurzar consists
of Hypericum, Salsolace&aelig;, Carduacea, and Hyoscyamus spinosus,
but Salsolace&aelig; occur in profusion and several species.</p>
<p>Hypericum enjoys to perfection, the faculty of condensing water on
its leaves, much more so than Salsolace&aelig;; it presents an obvious
affinity to Rutace&aelig;, capsula radiata 5-valvis, loculicida: valvis
linea centrali notatis, septis solutis imo apice exceptis.&nbsp; Seminibus
basi locul. affixis, apice villosis; the tobacco is different from the
Nicot. tobaccum, cor. virida tubo calyce, duplo longiore lamina brevi
plicato: apricots in sheltered places.</p>
<p><i>24th</i>.&mdash;Kurzar.&nbsp; The Erak <i>kotul</i> is thickly
covered with Festuca triticoides, two Carduace&aelig;, Salvia, Artemisi&aelig;,
and Statices on the south side.&nbsp; On the north Statices, Onosma,
and Carduace&aelig; are most common, and the vegetation is scantier.&nbsp;
Ribes is common up the Erak ravine; with it, Rosa and Symphorema are
the chief shrubs.&nbsp; Ephedra ceases about 10,000 feet.&nbsp; A snake
found of general grey colour, with black-brown marking.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;Ascended Kohi-Baba from upper Kaloo, the ascent
occupied about five hours, the ridge was surmounted but no view of Baissoat
was obtained, except that the crest surmounted, as well as the still
loftier culminating one belong to ridges running 30&deg; north from
a main ridge, the passes of which, although apparently the same height
as the peak surmounted, are much more heavily covered with snow.&nbsp;
These passes do not appear very difficult.</p>
<p>At 2 P.M. set up the barometer on the ridge, the mercury stood 17.354.&nbsp;
Therm. in cistern, 79.5.&nbsp; Detached Therm. in sun 85&deg;&mdash;on
the ground 105&deg;.</p>
<p><i>September</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;At 2&frac12; P.M. the barometer
stood 17.356.</p>
<p>Assuming this to give about 15,000 feet, none of the peaks will be
found to be higher than 16,500.&nbsp; The culminating point was close
by, and did not appear more than 1,000 feet above me.&nbsp; The different
ridges are separated by deep spaces in which snow lies to a considerable
extent.</p>
<p>Having descended a considerable way I again set up the barometer.&nbsp;
Time 4-45 P.M.</p>
<p>The mercury stood at 18.889.</p>
<pre>    Therm. in the Cistern.  63&deg;
    Ditto in the air.       68&deg;</pre>
<p>The vegetation continues unaltered, the same as that of Kaloo kotul.</p>
<p>Carduace&aelig;, Astragali, Nardoid, Bromoid, Hordeoid pubescens,
and Statices.&nbsp; And up to this, which may be assumed as 13,500 feet,
the hills present the same features, rounded with a good deal of soil,
and large granitic masses.</p>
<p>But above this the disintegration of the ridge has reached a great
extent; for 1,500 to 2,000 feet the ascent is steep, passing over a
profusion of blocks and slabs of granite, generally externally of a
dark brown colour; here and there there is some coarse granular soil,
and towards the second station, say at an altitude of 14,000 feet, a
marshy spot occurred, crowded with Primula, together with Arenaria,
Fumaria of Erak, Ranunculus of Hajeeguk, Carex, etc.&nbsp; From within
1,000 feet of the summit the ascent was easier, over ground composed
entirely of small angular bits of granite, which rock protrudes to the
north, forming the south wall of a huge amphitheatre, heavily snowed
in places.</p>
<p>This granite varies much; being below a coarse quartzose grey rock,
above a very compact brown rock, except perhaps in its lowest outcrop,
where it has a slaty structure.</p>
<p>The second station may be assumed as the lowest limit of the inferior
snow line, but this so much depends on casual circumstances that even
many places at 15,000 feet are uncovered by snow, which as might be
expected is always heaviest in the higher valleys which are least exposed
to the sun&rsquo;s rays.&nbsp; The surface of the snow in many places
was picturesque, being in the shape of crowded pinnacled ridges, the
interstices from 4 to 5 feet deep, holding water or ice.&nbsp; I saw
from the summit a flock of the large grouse, and at 14,000 feet, a large
hare.</p>
<p>The peak surmounted is the lowest, and the nearest to Upper Kaloo.&nbsp;
The granite on the west side formed a precipitous cliff of 200 to 300
feet deep.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the slope with small fragments, say between 14
to 15,000 feet was very scanty, a Cheiranthus, Polygonum scariosum,
Papaverace&aelig;, Phloxoides and Statice, being the only plants; and
perhaps this may be assumed as having no particular plant, all those
enumerated being found below.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the steep rugged portion, which contained many
patches of snow and better soil, was more varied; in the upper parts
of this a Carex, two or three Gramin&aelig;, Cheiranthus, Plectranthus,
Sedoides, Arenaria, Potentilla, Primula, Draboides and Brassicacea occurred.&nbsp;
A Tanacetoid was perhaps the most common.</p>
<p>The most alpine forms of these were Carex, Holcoides, Sedoides, Statice
densissima, and Papaveracea; but of these Papaveracea, Phloxoid, Statice
densissima, Cheiranthus, and Polygonum are alone found above.&nbsp;
Here again the effect of the proximity of a bed of snow in retarding
vegetation was most evident.&nbsp; Phloxoides elsewhere partly in flower,
being found in full flower near one of the beds of snow.</p>
<p>It is curious that no green spots are found above, all the water
passing down under the soil, the swardy ravines scarcely extend beyond
an elevation of 1,500 feet above the camp on Upper Kaloo.</p>
<p>The limit of the grey shrubby Salix may be taken as 1,000 feet above
that, the other plants are precisely the same as those of other swards;
Abelia extends higher than Salix.</p>
<p>The limit of crops is about the same, the issue of the water obviously
being in relation to the extent of cultivation by irrigation.&nbsp;
The associated plants present no change.</p>
<p><i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Cabul.&nbsp; Curious transformation in Carthamus
was observed, either affecting the involucrum alone, when those branches
that would have become flowers become clavate, covered with very dense
aristate leaves, or affecting the florets which become more or less
converted in the branches.&nbsp; In these the involucre is little altered,
and the receptacle is attacked by larva.&nbsp; In certain of these the
florets are submitted to very curious metamorphoses, each envelope remaining,
but quite green, the stamina being little changed, the pistillum changed
into a leaf-bearing branch, the stigmata, etc. into two leaves.</p>
<p>This is chiefly remarkable because of the general tardiness of change
in the stamina, since it shows that the binary formation of the pistillum
is a primary effect: it may be asked, if the number should be 5, why
has it not reverted to its original or typical state?&nbsp; The calyx
is not reducible to 5.&nbsp; The permanency of the character of aggregate
flowers is here shown, as well as in Echinops, so that it is scarcely
probable we shall ever meet a compositious flower solitary in the axil
of an ordinary leaf.</p>
<p>To be examined hereafter in detail.</p>
<p>If wood is a descending formation, produced by leaves, how are woody
tendrils to be accounted for.&nbsp; In the vine the ancient tendrils
are perfectly woody, although this may not be true wood, yet it is truly
fibrous, and I ask, from what is it formed?</p>
<p>The growth of young shoots is at once a proof that the whole system
may be formed from ascending growth, for in many we find woody fibre
complete, though not indurated, and all the leaves from which wood is
said to be formed are only in a rudimentary state.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;Seh-Baba.&nbsp; Spir&aelig;a belloides,
commonish on limestone rocks in the ravine near the road which leads
from Tazeen valley to Khubur-i-Jubbur.&nbsp; This limestone is in thin
strata; the strata are subdivided by quartzose veins, they occur generally
at a dip of from 15 to 20 degrees, but are occasionally quite vertical
or highly wavy, presenting evidence of concentrated force upwards.&nbsp;
The outcrop wears an uniform aspect, and occurs to the north of the
ravine.&nbsp; The south here and there presents sheets of rock, the
overlying strata having slipped off.&nbsp; The strike of the strata
is north and south.</p>
<p>Coal is said by Hatchet to be formed chiefly from the resinous principles
of plants,&mdash;this would account for its appearance when burnt, which
is the same as that of burnt bitumen.&nbsp; But resinous principles
are, even when they exist, of partial extent only in plants.&nbsp; In
good coal the whole of the vegetable substance seems to be transformed,
a supposition barely compatible with Hatchet&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>To study this, extensive examination of coal in all degrees of formation
would be necessary, beginning with the wood so curiously changed by
the Brahmapootra, i.e. brown coal occurring in its sand banks, and which
has a very peculiar and disagreeable odour when burning.&nbsp; It would
also be necessary to examine how far the coal-plants exhibit vegetable
structure, are they mere impressions or are they the plants themselves
changed?&nbsp; To what extent do these agree with coal?&nbsp; What particular
plants and what parts of these appear to have formed coal?&nbsp; Its
fibrous structure would hint at formation from the woody system, and
it is not incompatible with the <i>deliquescence</i> of a thick layer
of drift.</p>
<p>The plants of coal fields having been drifted, can only give us an
idea of the vegetation along the natural drains of the then country,
such may by no means have had <i>one</i> <i>universal</i> <i>character</i>.</p>
<p>The plants of the open surface of modern tropical countries being
generally different from those along the beds of streams, in which situations
now-a-days Equisete&aelig;, Lycopods and Filicis are chiefly found.&nbsp;
Coal being drift, it follows that the plants of the coal fields can
give us no information on the distribution of vegetables in those days;
to gain information on this, the fossils should be in their original
situation.&nbsp; And there again an obstacle may exist in our not being
able to ascertain the height or level of that situation.</p>
<p>If the plants of coal fields are found to be converted into coal,
then the only difference between coal shale, and coal will consist in
the very small proportion of vegetable matter in the former.</p>
<p>The small number of coal plants, i.e. the small number of species,
at once points to the supposition that fossil plants are confined to
those of the most indestructible nature: here again is another sign
of this in the preponderance of Ferns, which Lindley finds to be the
most permanent.</p>
<p>Hence the preponderance of Ferns, is by no means explainable by their
greatest simplicity of form, and consequent priority of formation.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>
<p><i>From</i> <i>Peshawur</i> <i>to</i> <i>Lahore</i>.</p>
<p><i>October</i> <i>14th</i>.&mdash;Peshawur.&mdash;Cucurbitace&aelig;.&nbsp;
The petals of cucurbita were observed in one instance united along two
of the corollal sinuses to the staminal column, alternating with the
smaller stamina; the processes were produced upwards into petaloid appendages.</p>
<p><i>17th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Nowshera.&nbsp; As far as Pubbe the
road extended chiefly through a cultivated country, thence as far as
could be judged at night, over a plain country covered with coarse grass,
and here and there (whenever a sufficiently gravelly surface occurred)
among the thick of <i>Bheir</i>, which is here used for fences; Mudar,
&AElig;rua, Nerioides and Adhatoda occurred; <i>Furas</i> a common tree.</p>
<p><i>18th</i>.&mdash;Reached Khairabad.&nbsp; The same kind of country
as about Nowshera, stony or sandy, with extensive tracts covered with
<i>Bheir</i>, Mudar, and &AElig;rua as before, Mimosa common towards
Geedur Gulli, and on it also Kureel, which appears for the first time
as it was not seen about Jumrood.&nbsp; On to-day&rsquo;s march many
grasses are apparent, the pale Saccharoid grass of Jugdulluck common,
a species of Cynodon (given to me by Dr. Ritchie at Dhukk) very common,
a Pommereullioid, a curious Sch&oelig;nanthus, a Poa, all are coarse
and cover a large tract towards Geedur Gulli: Barleria spinosa appears.</p>
<p>Geedur Gulli is a ravine winding in and out in a curious manner among
low hills at the north-west end of what is called the Afredi Spur.&nbsp;
Mimosa very common, Kureel, Dodon&aelig;a and Edgeworthia, neither very
common, but Moarcurra and Euonymus are both rather common.&nbsp; <i>Mudar</i>
common; some Andropogons, of which one is the same as that of the Khyber.&nbsp;
<i>Bheir</i> very common, also a Mimosa like the common <i>Babool</i>,
but flowers unscented.&nbsp; Chokeys, or police stations are situated
along the whole line of road to Peshawur.&nbsp; Adhatoda common at the
entrance to Geedur Gulli where the scenery is rather pretty; Adiantum
common on banks near the water; the hills of Geedur Gulli are rather
thickly sprinkled with wood.</p>
<p>The Cabul river is here a large stream, with a moderate confined
bed between high banks on which Akora and Khairabad are situated.&nbsp;
The view of the Indus from Geedur Gulli presents a desolate look of
sand, which extends over a large space visible through a break in the
hills to the north.&nbsp; The passage of the Indus through the Attock
range seen from the same point is curious; but general remarks on scenery
can be of no use, except when they are founded on an intimate acquaintance
with the country.&nbsp; The most natural course, i.e. one less impeded
by mountains, would seem to be to the east instead of south.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m491.jpg">
<img alt="Diagram of Attock Range" src="images/m491.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Mulberry, Salix angustifolia, or willow, and <i>Buckein</i>, were
seen at Attock.&nbsp; The scenery is not however bold, but on the contrary
very poor compared with the defiles of the Irrawadi.&nbsp; The hills
are low, rounded, and present no precipices of striking dimensions.&nbsp;
An old fort situated near the junction of the rivers is a handsome looking
building, but completely commanded.&nbsp; A large Serai or place for
travellers is situated near it to the north.&nbsp; The water of the
Indus is muddy, but presents nothing remarkable in temperature.&nbsp;
The analogous points between the Indus and Irrawadi consist in defiles
and the want of branches for a long way above their mouths.&nbsp; Jackdaws
were the first old acquaintances I met with on entering Peshawur; and
the common kite, the Affghan one not having the same thrilling cry that
the Indian one has; grey partridges are found about Nowshera; as also
Kuchaloo or Yams.</p>
<p><i>19th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded over the plain to Chuch and Khot-bha,
winding along the Attock hill round to the fort, and passing the Serai,
and another smaller one in ruins near the plains, thence over level
ground to within two miles of Bhowli, where conspicuous trees were observed,
otherwise the plain is rather barren, a few <i>Bheirs</i> and some Ph&oelig;nix
only occurring about villages on hills.&nbsp; The vegetation is the
same.&nbsp; Chuch plain, where not cultivated, is covered with short
coarse grasses, Andropogone&aelig;.&nbsp; Among these a large-leaved
Salvia occurs.&nbsp; The forms presented by the vegetation are however
very little diversified.&nbsp; Mudar, a small-fruited Kochia, like that
of Jallalabad; B&oelig;rhaavia very common.</p>
<p>Cultivation is conducted in <i>Bheir</i> fences, and consists of
Indian-corn, <i>Bajra</i>, and cotton.</p>
<p>From the Attock hills, the Indus is seen much divided by beds of
sand, and churs or islands covered with a large purple Saccharum.&nbsp;
Peganum continues to Attock and even extends beyond.</p>
<p>Water plants of Chuch, Trapa, Valisneria verticillata, and Nymph&aelig;a.</p>
<p>Shumshbad.&mdash;This town lies to the left of the road, one mile
in the rear of my encampment.</p>
<p>The spines of Barleria are evidently axillary, as is seen in young
branches, probably they represent the lower pair of leaves of the lateral
branches, the terminal parts of which have a tendency to develop.</p>
<p>The spines of Mimosa belong evidently to the same exertion as the
leaf; they are connate at the base, and from the centre of this hardened
part, arises the leaf; they may be either the lower pinn&aelig;, or
they may be <i>spurious</i> stipul&aelig;.&nbsp; The leaves developed
within the true ones belong to an ill-developed branch.&nbsp; True stipul&aelig;
are leaves with a distinct origin.&nbsp; Spurious stipul&aelig; belong
to their leaves, as is evident from their not having a distinct origin.</p>
<p><i>20th</i>.&mdash;Hussun Abdul.&nbsp; Until we came near the Boorhan
valley, the road passed over a high, dry, sandy plain, with no cultivation,
and no water, then the descent took place through picturesque raviny
ground with a few isolated mounds, to a fine clear stream.&nbsp; The
remaining part extended either along the cultivation of the Boorhan
valley, or through similar raviny ground.&nbsp; Two streams were passed,
the last is the Hussun Abdul river.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the high plain continues the same.&nbsp; <i>Bheir</i>,
Mimosa, <i>Kureel</i>, &AElig;rua, Mudar, Andropogone&aelig;, Pommereullia,
&OElig;gilops, Salvia, and Crotalaria aphylla.</p>
<p>Among the ravines and thence to Hussun Abdul, a new feature presents
itself in the frequency of a largish Mimosa, probably that of the Khyber
pass.&nbsp; This forms prettily wooded scenery, the white thorned Mimosa
also occurs, Moacurra none, Euonymus, <i>Bheir</i>.</p>
<p>About Boorhan a Ficus becomes very common, Achyranthes, Kochia fructibus
parvis, Salvia, Serratuloid of Ali-Baghan and Ichardeh.&nbsp; Paganum
common&mdash;Adhatoda and Vitex.&nbsp; In scenery the country is pretty,
particularly after passing the last river: a dampish spot was passed
at Bhowli: a large Acacia, Melanoxylon and Pteris were found on the
river banks.&nbsp; Dodon&aelig;a seen on low hills near Bhowli, as also
Adiantum.&nbsp; Started at 5 hours 40 minutes and reached at 11.30;
distance at least eighteen miles.</p>
<p>Hussun Abdul, is a pretty place, particularly the broken ground about
the sacred stream, and the tank, in which Mahaseers abound; the water
beautiful, many trees occur, especially Morus, Salix and Ficus.</p>
<p>Zyziphus is a fine tree here, Ph&oelig;nix, Khuggur, Bukkein, Ficus,
and Cupressus occur.</p>
<p>The jackdaw, <i>mina</i>, blue and chesnut kingfisher, a noisy bird.&nbsp;
The small kingfisher, black and white kingfisher common: Myophonus,
Pomatorrhinus.</p>
<p><i>21st</i>.&mdash;The chief cultivation here is <i>bajra</i>, and
Zea maize.&nbsp; The former produces a second crop from branches; hence
it is left standing after the top spike, which is the largest, is picked;
vegetation chiefly Indian, very few Affghan forms remaining, those of
the hills are Mimosa, Adhatoda, and Euonymus.</p>
<p>The water plants are all decidedly tropical; no Epilobium seen since
leaving Peshawar: Eclipta, Cyperace&aelig;.</p>
<p>Trichodesma, Cannabis.</p>
<p>Fish have few engaging habits, the tame Mahaseers take no notice
of any one until food is thrown to them.</p>
<p>Tagetes, <i>Sud</i> <i>Buruk</i>, is a curious genus, on account
of its simple tubular involucrum, very entire and pappus florets, conduplicate
in &aelig;stivation, all florets f&aelig;minine are ligulate; are the
folded up ones representations of the males?</p>
<p><i>22nd</i>.&mdash;To Janika Sung, seventeen miles: the country continues
much the same.&nbsp; The road passes out of <i>Hussun</i> <i>Abdul</i>
over a low stony elevation, and enters another valley, the exit from
which is through the Maha Gullah: a large Serai is passed about two
and a half miles from the Boorgi; in the Gullah near this, is a portion
of a formed road.&nbsp; Janika Sung is a small village, about five miles
from the Boorgi.</p>
<p>The face of the country is undulated, intersected by ravines, rather
thickly covered with the large Mimosa and <i>Bheir</i>: the same may
be seen in every direction.</p>
<p>Affghan plants have nearly ended, Moacurra and Euonymus alone continuing.&nbsp;
At the Maha Gullah a Carissa, and a <i>Zaitoon</i>, Ehretioides.&nbsp;
This defile is picturesque, the wood prettily contrasted with bits of
grassy ground.&nbsp; Adhatoda in abundance.</p>
<p>The Maha Gullah was formerly a notorious place for robbers, but is
now quite safe, which says much for the Seikh rule.</p>
<p>There was not much cultivation passed to-day, although most of the
surface is fit for it: water is near the surface.&nbsp; The Maha Gullah
range is composed of limestone.</p>
<p>The white-spined Mimosa and crooked-spined one change places, the
former occupies uncultivated plains, the latter stony, undulated, or
hilly ground.</p>
<p>Carissa certainly represents Jasminum.</p>
<p>On the Kaliki Serai plain the chief plant is Mimosa albispina, then
<i>Bheir</i>&mdash;here and there patches of Leguminosa, like the Cytisoides,
so common in Affghanistan.&nbsp; In the <i>Bheir</i> thickets Sch&oelig;nanthus
is common; Andropogon and Pommereullioid also occur.</p>
<p>In the Hussun Abdul river there is a species of Perilampus approaching
to Leuciscus, but with faint bars.&nbsp; In the sacred stream there
is a small Cyprinoid, probably a Systomus, with a conspicuous spot on
either side near the tail: there is also a small loach.</p>
<p>The Mahaseer in the water is a handsome fish, the edges of the scales
being then blackish, as is also the longitudinal line.</p>
<p>It is curious that all plants hitherto found parasitical on roots,
have no green leaves; to this, marked exceptions exists in Cuscuta and
Cassytha, such true-leaved parasites being found only on the ascending
axis; this rule is so permanent, that species of certain genera, such
as Burmannia, the bulk of which are not parasitical, have no leaves.&nbsp;
The mode of attachment of all parasitical plants is I think the same,
otherwise I should suspect the above difference to point to a marked
one in the nature of the fluid derived from the stock: thus leafless
plants might be supposed to induce no particular change in the fluid
they imbibe, while the others might be supposed to elaborate their own
from that of the stock.</p>
<p>There is another very remarkable circumstance connected with the
most typical leafless parasites, in their very frequent limitation to
the genus Cissus, on which perhaps all Rafflesiace&aelig; and Cynomorie&aelig;
are exclusively found.</p>
<p>My chief reason for supposing Sarcocodon to be Monocotyledonous,
or rather Endogenous, is the ternary division of its parts, and if my
supposition be correct, it tends to establish, if indeed other ample
evidence did not exist, the great permanence and consequent value of
this numerical character.</p>
<p>And with respect to Sarcocoidalis I shall adopt the same opinion,
if I find on enquiry that a binary number, and imperfection of the female
as compared with the male, are more characteristic of Endogenous than
of Exogenous growth.&nbsp; This same genus I consider in both these
characters to allude to some analogy with one or more Acrogenous divisions.</p>
<p>The establishment of the order of Rhizanths, as well as that of Gymnosperms,
I consider as a retrograde step in Botanical science.&nbsp; It is totally
opposed to all sound principles of classification, and is a proof that,
in the nineteenth century, arbitrary characters are still sought for,
and when found are obstinately maintained.</p>
<p>Even in the arbitrary character, which is considered as destructive
of all their other claims to ordinary vegetable rank, there is no unison
whatever, for Rafflesiace&aelig; have ordinary ovula, while Sarcocoidalis
very extraordinary.</p>
<p>The amount of testimony proving their analogy in germination to be
with Acrogens, must be very strong before I am convinced that plants
with perfect ovula as Rafflesia, etc. germinate from an indeterminate
point, the existence of an aperture in the coats, points in the most
marked manner to some part representing a radicle.&nbsp; With the exception
perhaps of Sarcocoidalis, these plants differ in no respect whatever
from other Ph&aelig;nogamous vegetables; we have instances of the same
parasitical growth, and instances of the same apparent want of a radicle
or homogeneousness of embryo, and in the structure of the parts of the
flower there is tolerably absolute general identity.</p>
<p>It may be worthy of remark, as tending to prove the soundness of
Mr. Brown&rsquo;s views with regard to the affinity of Rafflesia with
Aristolochia, that a certain large and fleshy flowered species of the
latter genus has the same putrescent smelling flowers.</p>
<p>In Rhizanthe&aelig;, as proposed by Endlicher, we have an assemblage
of discordant characters; we have plants associated, differing in the
number of their parts; we have some of comparatively simple roots associated
with others of decidedly complex organization; we have Rafflesia in
which highly complex female parts exist, associated with Sarcocoidalis,
in which these are very simple.&nbsp; But besides the objection of combining
discrepancies on the strength of one agreement, the establishment of
divisions upon such pretexts is objectionable in another point of view;
viz., that of making a transition of structure on one point, instead
of in several.</p>
<p>We might as well form into one division all the ternarily formed
Dicotyledons, and into another all those Monocotyledonous plants with
evident distinction between the calyx and corolla.</p>
<p>But in addition to reasons founded on structure, I have this theoretical
one, that it is as requisite that Endogens should establish a similar
relation with Acrogens; otherwise a gradation exists between the first
and third classes, and none between the second and third, between which,
gradations ought to be the more frequent.</p>
<p>As Rafflesia approaches Aristolochia, so does Sarcocodon, Taccace&aelig;.</p>
<p><i>23rd</i>.&mdash;Rawil Pendi.&nbsp; The country continues much
the same to within five or six miles of this place, viz. high raviny
ground, well covered with Mimosa, <i>Bheir</i>, etc.</p>
<p>Thence to Pendi, the country is open, bare, and much cultivated.&nbsp;
From high ground near Pendi a considerable tract is visible, consisting
of low ridges running nearly due south, interrupted here and there,
and apparently quite bare.</p>
<p><i>24th</i>.&mdash;To Manikyala, distance nineteen miles, over an
elevated country, with not much cultivation; broken ground occurs here
and there, especially near the river Hoomook, now a small stream, the
road winding through Mimosa jungle.&nbsp; <i>Moacurra</i>, <i>Bheir</i>,
Euonymus.</p>
<p>At a place about three miles from Manikyala, are the remains of a
Serai now in ruins.&nbsp; From this to Metope, the road extends over
an open country capable of cultivation, but neglected.&nbsp; Water in
wells is thirty feet perhaps below the surface: the country about Tope
very bare of trees.</p>
<p>A curious low chain of sandstone rocks here occurs, and occasionally
protrudes in places from below the soil, seldom rising above five feet
and occasionally dilated into undulated tracts.</p>
<p>Drill husbandry, (i.e. seeds sown after the plough,) seems much in
practice here.&nbsp; The late noise about improving pasture grasses
has been made with little reference to the nature of an Indian climate,
or the genius of the Indian people.&nbsp; Pasture grasses only excel
in countries where there is no division of climate into hot, rainy,
and cold seasons; but not in those in which rain is equally, or nearly
so distributed throughout the year.&nbsp; So far as I know, no place
in India is calculated for pasture grass cultivation, because as none
of excellent kinds can succeed without irrigation, this element of Indian
agriculture is applied to more profitable cultures, such as artificial
grasses.&nbsp; In the cold season and the rains, nature supplies <i>dhoob</i>
grass bountifully, leaving the natives to apply their agricultural labour
to other objects, and in such seasons the condition of cattle is decidedly
good.</p>
<p>Manikyala Tope, seen from near Rawil Pendi, is an insignificant building,
and presents the same architecture as other topes, and as the Cabul
tower, although it is not of the same materials.&nbsp; The lower part
of the base is of pure sandstone, the upper of a stalactital conglomerate
of small pebbles, often perforated.&nbsp; The terraces at the base are
now almost hid by rubbish, so that the whole looks like an overgrown
dome or a low mound.&nbsp; There are three stone ledges below, with
flat pilasters between the middle and lower ledge on the sides.&nbsp;
The dome is much damaged.&nbsp; The stones of which the building was
erected, were not hewn inside, but I do not know whether they have not
been cemented together.&nbsp; Access is easy to the top partly by means
of broken steps, otherwise the stones gave good footing.&nbsp; The top
of the ruin is now open and discloses a square <i>funnel</i>, penetrating
half the height of building; thence modern handiwork has caused a broken
irregular perforation.&nbsp; The building is not remarkable for great
size, nor are any of the stones large, still as a piece of architecture
it is far superior to any thing in modern Affghanistan.&nbsp; The country
around is very bare and sufficiently open.&nbsp; It is curious that
there are many Indian plants found on or about the building, all indicating
a decided approach to Hindoostan.&nbsp; A Sida, Euonymus, Bheir, Lantana,
and a Menispermum, are common shrubs on the building, also Solanum quercifolium,
spinis albis floribus c&oelig;ruleo purpureis.</p>
<p><i>25th</i>.&mdash;To Puttiana, seventeen to eighteen miles; the
country much the same, little wood but bushes of the old trees: it is
tolerably open until Pukkee Serai is approached, when it becomes very
much broken and intersected by ravines in every direction, showing most
forcibly the action of water, many of the cliffs thus formed are picturesque.&nbsp;
At Pukkee a small river is forded, thence to near Puttiana the country
then becomes almost as raviny as before.</p>
<p>&AElig;rua, Bheir, Mudar, a Kochia, much like one of the Cutch ones,
and the before-mentioned plants continue.</p>
<p><i>26th</i>.&mdash;To Bukriala, twenty-two miles.&nbsp; From Puttiana
the road is good, extended over a high open country, except where it
crosses two ravines; the first of these containing a stream of water,
about ten miles from Puttiana.&nbsp; From Tammuch the road descends
steeply into the Bukriala Kakhudd ravine, which takes you to Bukriala.</p>
<p>This ravine runs through a system of sandstone hills, of a blueish
muddy aspect, and red clayey earth, often conglomerate.&nbsp; In colours
not unlike the Bamean district.&nbsp; Water is plentiful in pools throughout
the lower half of the road, which is all descent.&nbsp; Bukriala stands
on the right bank of the Khudd river towards its mouth, the vegetation
about this place resembles that of the open country, and is unchanged
in the Khudd river, consisting of Kochia, <i>Phulahi</i>, and Mimosa
albispina, Euonymus, <i>Bheir</i>, Adhatoda, Barleria, <i>Kureel</i>,
and Capparis of Gundamuck; also Pommereullioid, Andropogon, Sch&oelig;nanthus,
Holcus, and Stipa of Kuta Sung, Carallunia, Grewia and Menispermum of
Manikyala.</p>
<p>Also two plants not before seen, and neither common, one is a Butea,
leguminous velutino pubescent arbor, it is the <i>Chuchra</i> of the
natives, and is used for paper.&nbsp; The other is a curious, leafless,
scandent, monocotyledon.&nbsp; Asparaginea, and an Apocynea.</p>
<p>Alhaji Maurorum is not found between this and Hussun Abdul, which
is a curious thing.</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;To Rotas.&nbsp; The country to Mittian is very
much broken and consequently difficult, consisting entirely of ups and
downs: the road is only practicable for cattle; the bad part of it commences
with an abrupt ascent.&nbsp; About Puttiana, four miles from Bukriala,
it becomes better, but it continues partially raviny until within four
miles of Rotas, when the country becomes open, and the road good.</p>
<p>Vegetation continues precisely the same, being still in the region
of <i>Phulahi</i>: observed the Asparaginea again, Euonymus continues,
also Astragalus, a Kochia, and an Affghan Chenopodium.</p>
<p>A beautiful <i>bhowli</i> or spring is passed on the way two miles
from Rotas, it is covered with masonry, and the descent is by means
of steps; the water passes under large arches, a work worthy of the
Mogul emperors.&nbsp; Sissoo, Peroplocea of Bolan, common.&nbsp; Rotas
is an immense irregular fortress, with the usual faults: it is much
too large, and situated on a rocky plain partially commanded.&nbsp;
It must have once contained a large number of inhabitants.&nbsp; Nelumbium,
Potamogeton: half a mile from Rotas towards Peshawur, a square Serai,
enclosing a garden, is passed.</p>
<p>The country immediately about it on the west is open: and well cultivated:
there is but little water in the river.&nbsp; The town or village is
of no size.</p>
<p>Butea not uncommon.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Jhilun.&nbsp; The road is at first
steep, as it passes down along the Rotas river, about three miles from
thence it is good, extending over a plain to the Jhilun.&nbsp; Fine
cultivation observed on all sides, and of various sorts, chiefly <i>Bajra</i>
and <i>Kureel</i>.&nbsp; Dhah abundant, but not arborescent, Euonymus,
Peganum, <i>Bheir</i>, and <i>Phulahi</i>, the latter very dwarfish.&nbsp;
Mimosa albispina and Adhatoda very common.&nbsp; The commonest tree
in these countries is <i>Bheir</i>, and a very handsome tree it is;
<i>Nihi</i>-<i>joari</i> cultivated.</p>
<p><i>Sun</i> and <i>Tel</i> occur, the last is very common.&nbsp; Yesterday
a new cultivation presented of a Composite plant, called <i>Kalizeen</i>,
used as spice or <i>musala</i> for horses.&nbsp; The birds observed
were H&aelig;matornis, Crateropod, Sylvia, Alauda cristata, Alauda alia
in flocks.</p>
<p>The town of Jhilun stands immediately on the right bank of the river
of that name, it is a large and flourishing place.&nbsp; The river is
about 200 yards broad, not rapid, but here and there deep, and the bed
at this place forms one undivided channel.&nbsp; The right bank on which
the town stands has a stony sloping shore, the left is sandy.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to suppose that the hilly country ceases here, on
the contrary, it crosses the Jhilun.&nbsp; At the ferry this river runs
through a large valley, bounded to the west by hills like those to which
we have been accustomed; to the east it is bounded by a low chain, which
runs parallel with the general course of the river.&nbsp; The valley
is open only to the north and south.</p>
<p>Otters, tortoises, and Mahaseer were seen in the river.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;To Sera, twenty-four miles, half the distance
extended over the uncultivated base of the hills, and then over the
low range itself, from which at two points, fine views are obtained
of the vast plain of the Punjab.&nbsp; Throughout this vast surface
the vegetation is exactly the same&mdash;Euonymus continuing, Peganum
and <i>Phulahi</i> forming chief vegetation; numbers of white partridge
occur.</p>
<p>In the plains <i>Dhah</i> is found in profusion, especially where
the cultivation is not extensive.&nbsp; A new Acacia appears, the <i>Kikkur</i>,
forming groves about most of the villages.&nbsp; Noticed the Physaloides
of Lundykhanah.&nbsp; Encamped under a fine Mimosa and <i>Bheir</i>
near an old Serai which forms part of the village, with a splendid view
of the Himalayas stretching away from east to west.&nbsp; It appears
from this direction as if there was only one low range between the plains
and the culminating range of the Himalayas.&nbsp; Nothing like these
mountains has been seen in Khorassan.&nbsp; The chief cultivation about
here is <i>Nihi</i>-<i>joari</i>, then <i>Bajra</i>&mdash;why is the
former always bent?</p>
<p>Prickly pear common from where we crossed the Jhilun river.</p>
<p>A curious metamorphosis of Sesamum is of common occurrence: the calyx
being unchanged, while the corolla preserves somewhat its shape, but
is foliaceous, the other organs are much transformed, the ovary less
so than the stamina, but generally much enlarged; <i>ovules</i> <i>in</i>
<i>leaves</i> inside.&nbsp; This is worthy of examination, as it shows
very plainly the origin of the stigmata from the placent&aelig;.</p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;Halted owing to having been robbed of two horses.</p>
<p><i>31st</i>.&mdash;Wuzerabad, twenty-four miles.&nbsp; Ten miles
from Wuzerabad the road extended through a highly cultivated country,
and crossed the Chenab, on the left bank of which river Wuzerabad is
situated.&nbsp; The Chenab is a fine river, the stream 150 yards wide,
but on either side extensive beds of sand show that the river during
some seasons is of great width.</p>
<p>Wuzerabad is a nice well built town, having a fine straight bazaar,
with paved street.&nbsp; The chief gateways and residences built by
General Avitabile.</p>
<p>Chilodia occurs in abundance, Eleusine sp., E. coracana; <i>Bajra</i>
and <i>Joari</i> <i>Nihi</i> being the prevailing cultivation.</p>
<p>It is curious that in Phulahi major of Sera and the <i>Kikkur</i>,
the young branches only are armed with thorns, so that the spines must
be deciduous in certain species of Mimosa.</p>
<p>Cactus is an instance of a calyx composed of a congeries of adherent
leaves, which leaves produce from their axilla, tufts of white hair
and thorns; or is it not an instance of an axis hollowed out towards
the apex, to the sides of which the ovary finally adheres, in this case
the outermost series of the perianth will be calyx; one reason for adopting
this supposition, besides the axillary bodies, is that there is no gradation
between the small concave leaves of the calyx, and the outer series
of the perianth.</p>
<p><i>November</i> <i>1st</i>.&mdash;Halted for fishing: Cyorinus Mrigala,
is the <i>Mhoori</i> of these parts; it grows to a large size, is a
handsome fish, and is indeed considered the king of fishes by the Punjabees.&nbsp;
The intestines are in longitudinal folds of extremely small comparative
diameter, and enormous length; in a large specimen it is twenty-three
times the length of the body.&nbsp; The intestines of the <i>Mahaseer</i>
are on the other hand only two and a quarter times the length of the
body!</p>
<p>Of the fish obtained, two are Perilamps, here called <i>Rohi</i>,</p>
<pre>          5 or 6 Cyprinides,
          4 or 5 Siluri,
               2 Ophiocephali,
               1 Esox.
Indeed I obtained a list of twenty-four species.</pre>
<p><i>2nd</i>.&mdash;To Goograuwala, twenty-four and a half miles, over
a fine populous generally cultivated country.&nbsp; Goograuwala is a
large town, having the streets paved with brick like those of Wuzerabad.&nbsp;
Cactus very common; <i>Kikkur</i> (Mimosa) is the chief tree here about
the <i>Fukeer&rsquo;s</i> abodes.&nbsp; The Banyan also occurs.</p>
<p>Peganum and Kochia of Jallalabad continue.&nbsp; There is a fort
of some size close to this town, built of mud; the ditch is unfinished,
and not deep, it has a fau-se-braie, with bastions like those at Peshawur
and Jumrood.&nbsp; The surface of the ground is much broken close up
to it, the earth being taken away for bricks.</p>
<p><i>3rd</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to Koori, an inconspicuous village, belonging
to M. Court; it is surrounded by extensive plains, on which a tall grass
occurs to a great extent.&nbsp; Distance twenty-eight and a half miles,
the time taken for to-day&rsquo;s journey was six and a quarter hours.</p>
<p>The country is precisely similar to that previously noticed, the
only new feature being the grassy plains, in which at some little distance
from Koori, deer, partridge, hares, etc. are said to abound.</p>
<p>A sissoo-like tree is not uncommon.</p>
<p><i>4th</i>.&mdash;To Shah Durrah, twenty-three and a half miles at
Nunzul, eight miles from Shah Durrah, a fort with ditch out of repair
was passed, at Koori ten miles from Shah Durrah, passed a deep Nullah
called Baghbuchah, with high banks, thence entered on a tract of country
covered with Saccharum, (<i>Moong</i>), from which ropes are made; (this
is the same as the Chuch species,) we next entered on cultivation close
to Shah Durrah, which place is well wooded.</p>
<p>Mangoe trees, <i>Ams</i>, Eugenia Jambolana, <i>Jams</i>, <i>Bheirs</i>,
Ph&oelig;nix, <i>Kikkur</i>, and Ficus, are the principal trees.</p>
<p>The grassy tracts of the Punjab represent probably the original vegetation,
existing now only here and there owing to the extension of cultivation.</p>
<p>From Shah Durrah Lahore is visible, particularly the buildings of
the Mogul emperor&rsquo;s, consisting of a conspicuous dome in ruins,
and some minarets, a large Serai likewise going to ruin, standing in
the immediate vicinity of the Royal Gardens, Lahore is decidedly a handsome
looking city viewed from Shah Durrah.</p>
<p>So great is the tendency in palms to throw out roots towards the
base, that these roots exist in the common <i>Khujoor</i>, although
they have to get rid of the indurated bases of the petioles before they
can make their exit.&nbsp; They are so extremely short and indurate
that it is difficult to imagine the function they perform; at first
they are capable probably of absorbing from the air.</p>
<p><i>5th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded to General Court&rsquo;s house at Lahore,
distance six miles, the road after crossing the Ravee river near a royal
summer house of no extraordinary merits, passes on to the town, and
then winds round under the Simon Boorge, a very striking part, at least
exteriorly of the city, for the buildings, works, etc. are in good repair.&nbsp;
Besides this the ground outside is swardy and prettily wooded.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>
<p><i>From</i> <i>Lahore</i> <i>to</i> <i>Simla</i>.</p>
<p>Lahore is surrounded by a ditch and wall, the work of former emperors&rsquo;
of Delhi; the environs of the city, particularly towards M. Court&rsquo;s
residence, are studded with mosques, etc. mostly half ruined, and the
ground is literally strewn with old bricks, so that the city must at
one time have been an enormous one.</p>
<p>Seikh troops in large numbers are cantoned round to the east and
south-east skirts of the town, in low pucka barracks.</p>
<p>Several low mounds apparently unconnected with ruins, occur in this
direction.</p>
<p>I arrived to hear of the death of Kurruck Sing, who was burned the
same day with five women; after the ceremony a scaffolding fell down,
wounding Nehal Sing dangerously in the head, and killing the son of
Goolab Sing.&nbsp; Late in the evening the Maharajah was senseless.</p>
<p>It is a curious thing, that the prince who this day ascended the
<i>guddee</i>, and Goolab Sing, had been active intriguers against Kurruck
Sing, who is said to have had his death hastened through chagrin at
witnessing Nehal Sing&rsquo;s usurpation of power.</p>
<p><i>6th</i>.&mdash;Not much cultivation was observed on the road to-day,
which extended over a naked marshy saline plain, or through a <i>Kureel</i>,
and small <i>Jundy</i> and <i>Phulahi</i> district.</p>
<p>To Kanah, seventeen miles&mdash;<i>Jundy</i>, <i>Kureel</i> and <i>Bheir</i>
occur extensively.&nbsp; <i>Jundy</i> is a low prickly shrub, Mimosa.&nbsp;
There is something curious both in the surface of the cavity enclosing
the seed, and in that of the seed itself of Acacia serissa.&nbsp; The
former presents the distinct appearance of a straight line, originating
in the same spot as the funicle, and terminating in a very well marked,
circular depression; it is formed by the funicle as far as the cells
of the legume.&nbsp; If a section be made through the seed longitudinally
and its cell parallel with the plane of the legume, this mark will be
found on both sides of the cell, but more distinct on one than the other.</p>
<p>The mark on the seed by no means relates to this, at least it does
not correspond with it, for it consists of a somewhat reniform elevated
ridge, the ends of which do not meet, but one of which originates from
an elevation to which the depression would seem to respond.&nbsp; The
straight line does not correspond with the funicle, which is not straight,
but is pushed up in a curved form against the upper edge of the cell.</p>
<p>It corresponds, however, with a straight subclavated line running
from the hilum to the elevation whence the curved line originates, although
this correspondence is not always well marked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/m504.jpg">
<img alt="Sketch of Jundy seed" src="images/m504.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The above marking, corresponding as it does in the flat part of the
legume with the funicle, evidently points to a peculiarity in the distribution
of the vascular system; probably it consists of the testa, and if so,
it is worthy of remark, as the main vessels ordinarily a single one,
run along the edge, and not on the flat surface of the fruit.</p>
<p>I know of no similar instance; in this plant the vessels of the testa
are distributed primarily at right angles with the placenta, and not
in parallel lines with that organ.&nbsp; If the seed were depressed
instead of compressed, it would not present this peculiarity, although
even then the two primary vessels would be remarkable.&nbsp; From this
instance it may be assumed that the hilum may only be defined correctly
as the spot of union between the body of the seed and the funiculus.&nbsp;
The leaflets of the plumula are pinnate.</p>
<p>It is also curious that the distribution of green parenchyma is along
the course of the veins of the legume, and that there is a more minute
reticulation, and a greater development of the green colour on the faces
of the cells, than on any other part of the surface of the legume.&nbsp;
There is no difference appreciable by the naked eye between the placental
and dorsal sutures, with the exception of the sutural line of union,
which has the usual relation with the axis of the head of the flowers&mdash;Euphorbia
occurs here.</p>
<p>The affinity of Cacte&aelig; with Grossulace&aelig; is questionable,
the systems of organization being very different.&nbsp; Query&mdash;What
instances are there of affinity between inferior ovary plants, with
distinct definite envelopes and stamina, and plants with a perhaps similar
ovary, but with indefinite envelopes and definite stamina with a want
of correspondence in the structure of the fruit?</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;To Kussoor, twenty miles.&nbsp; The road extended
generally through a <i>Jundy</i> country: about half-way Salvadora appears
in abundance.&nbsp; Kussoor is a large well-built town, consisting of
three separate parts, each surrounded by a <i>pucka</i> wall furnished
with bastions: these three parts are at some distance from each other.&nbsp;
<i>Furas</i> tree common.</p>
<p><i>8th</i>.&mdash;Ferozepore.&nbsp; About this place two species
of Kochia occur, and Artemisia is not uncommon.&nbsp; The Serratuloides
of Alli-Baghan and Ichardeh in profusion, affording cover for game.</p>
<p><i>16th</i> <i>to</i> <i>21st</i>.&mdash;Loodianah.&nbsp; In the
Nullah, Butomus begonifolius occurs.</p>
<p>The following are the fish of Loodianah taken both from the Nullah
and the Sutledge.</p>
<p><i>Roh</i>.&mdash;Cyprinus (Cirrhinus), a large, very handsome, excellent,
orange-brown fish, takes a bait but is capricious.</p>
<p><i>Rohoo</i>.&mdash;A sombre black-brown fish, intestines several
times the length of the body, said to be the young of the above.&nbsp;
Both these are different from the Roh or Ruee of the Ganges.</p>
<p><i>Coorsah</i>.&mdash;Labeo Cursis, a definite scaled sombre fish,
it is good food, and attains the size of two to three seers; intestines
twice the length of the body, very narrow.</p>
<p><i>Kkul</i> <i>Bhans</i>.&mdash;Cirrhinus Calbasu, a sombre looking
breamoid-shaped fish, attains the same size as the above, and is reputed
to be excellent food.</p>
<p><i>Mhirgh</i>.&mdash;Gobio Mrigala, a handsome fish, particularly
when young; form very elegant, intestines fourteen times the length
of the body; excellent food.</p>
<p><i>Bura</i> <i>Raiwah</i>.&mdash;Gobio Rewah, a very handsome, eight-cornered,
scaled fish, with orange fins and golden sides: takes no bait?</p>
<p><i>Chota</i> <i>Raiwah</i>.&mdash;Gobio occurs in shoals&mdash;either
occupied in busily turning up its silvery sides against the bottom,
or at the surface, above which it may be seen protruding its head.</p>
<p><i>Bhangun</i>.&mdash;Gobio, a handsome fish, not esteemed.</p>
<p><i>Potea</i>.&mdash;Systomus, takes bait&mdash;worms; affords good
sport and reaches to one seer, but is not esteemed; colours ordinary.</p>
<p><i>Systomus</i>, a beautiful fish, back shining green, sides yellow,
scales beautifully striate, with a spot near the tail; mostly found
in still water.</p>
<p><i>Gonorrhynchus</i>.&mdash;Snout rough, colours sombre, belly somewhat
protuberant; found with Systomus.&nbsp; The intestines are of the usual
form of the genus.</p>
<p>Gonorrhynchus, a sombre smaller fish, found in still water.</p>
<p><i>Bura</i> <i>Chalwa</i>.&mdash;Much esteemed as food in the districts
of the Sutledge.</p>
<p><i>Perilampus</i>.&mdash;Intestines shorter than the body, having
at the lower end a short curve; above green, from lateral line downwards
silvery.</p>
<p><i>Moh</i>.&mdash;A <i>Siluroid</i> fish, does not attain the size
of the real Moh, which is a higher or deeper formed fish.</p>
<p><i>Tengrei</i>.&mdash;Silurus platycephalus.&nbsp; Attains a very
large size.</p>
<p><i>Gudha</i>.&mdash;A Percoid.&nbsp; Colour irregular brown, mouth
very protractile.</p>
<p><i>Gughal</i>.&mdash;Ophiocephalus, a handsome fish, back rich greenish,
mottled brown, with 3 or 4 black spots on the sides, which are yellow,
passing off into white, and a peacock spot on the tail.&nbsp; Fins spotted
with white: it reaches a large size.</p>
<p><i>Bham</i>.&mdash;Macrognathus, body eel-shaped, with a row of movable
spines along the back.</p>
<p>About Loodianah, the Naiad of Affghanistan, Monandra, stigmatibus
reniformibus, is common in the Nullah, so also is Butomus begonifolius,
but this may be a leafless form of Sagittaria.</p>
<p>Towards Roopur, Sissoo becomes more and more common.&nbsp; Roopur
is a largish town, with a Seikh pucka fort on a mound.&nbsp; The fort
is surrounded by a dry ditch.&nbsp; The town is situated on a low, rather
rugged ground, forming the first elevations of the surface towards the
Himalayas; beyond it to the north-east is a low spur, also to the west
a similar spur, very barren, rugged, clayey rock forming the immediate
bank of the river.&nbsp; Every thing assimilates to the Bukriala and
Jhilun ranges.&nbsp; Saccharum, <i>Moong</i>, as before, <i>Bheir</i>
likewise occurs.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;nix, Dalbergia sissoo, Ficus, Adhatoda, Boerhaavia scandens,
Hyperanthera, Morus, Apluda, Tamarisk, Riccia, Ammannia, Euphorbia antiquorum,
Cactus, and Dodon&aelig;a, form the chief vegetation.</p>
<p>Some rapids occur near the Bungalow: the strongest is under a cliff
on the opposite side; no fish rose to red or black hackle or orange
flies, all which were tried in vain in the deep still water close under
Bungalow.&nbsp; The plants of this place are Guilandina, Grewia arbuscula
in fruit, Justicia, <i>Bheir</i>, <i>Neem</i>, Mango, Parkinsonia, the
latter rare.</p>
<p>Fish caught in net are Mullet, this fish is very active, and escapes
by jumping over.&nbsp; Silurus, Mahaseer, several of the latter taken
at a haul, the largest 10 lbs., it is a beautiful fish with golden sides,
scales black, with the anterior half bluish-black, posterior half tawny-yellow,
fins orange, lips very thick and leathery; it lives half or three-quarters
of an hour after it is taken out of its element.</p>
<p>The <i>Nepura</i> of the natives, Gobio malacostoma, or Rock Carp
of Gray, Hardwicke&rsquo;s Illustrations, is the <i>puhar</i>-<i>ka</i>
<i>muchee</i> of these parts: it has the base and edges of the scales
dull greenish-blue, fins dusky, a transverse pink line across the scales;
the length of the intestines is twenty-two and a half times that of
the body, filled with mud and coloured pulp, stomach continuous with
the intestine, and more fleshy, filled with green and whitish pulp,
and disposed in longitudinal folds.</p>
<p>The <i>Bangun</i>, Roh, (Gobio) is a splendid fish, base and edges
of the scales dusky brown, otherwise refulgent gilded, belly white,
fins dusky, head greenish-brown, less gilding about the dorsal scales.&nbsp;
This fish I have not seen elsewhere.&nbsp; Length of intestines disposed
in longitudinal folds, the posterior of which are nearly as long as
abdominal cavity, the whole twenty-seven and a half times the length
of the body.&nbsp; Organization and contents as in <i>Nepura</i>.&nbsp;
The breadth or depth of this fish immediately behind the opercule three
inches, across the body, opposite the first ray of dorsal fin, five
inches, first ray of anal three inches, length twenty-two inches.</p>
<p>Query&mdash;In which part of a fish intestines like that of the Mahaseer,
is the chief digestion carried on?</p>
<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;To Nalighur Bungalow, the distance rather less
than sixteen, but over fourteen miles through a similar country to that
round Roopur.&nbsp; The road passes a large village called Canowli;
at rather less than about half-way it extended across a sandy dry river
bed of some extent, on the right bank of which, at the highest part,
is a Seikh brick fort.&nbsp; The road subsequently passes the Sursa,
a small shallow rapid stream.&nbsp; The dry bed of which turns up on
the south side of the low range to the south of Nalighur valley.&nbsp;
No change in vegetation takes place, except the occurrence of a Croton,
much like that of the Pagoda near Canowli.</p>
<p>Trees observed&mdash;Eugenia Jambolana, Mangifera indica, Ficus,
<i>Bheir</i>, <i>Neem</i> or Melia Azadarach, Parkinsonia about the
bungalow.&nbsp; Toon, Cordia, Bauhinia, Bambusa, Emblica, Morus, Plumeria,
Mudar, Saccharum, <i>Moong</i>, Bheir fruticos and Kikkur are the most
common indigenous forms.&nbsp; Dhak in patches here and there: Cassia
also occurs.</p>
<p>Nalighur consists of a village and fort, the latter situated to the
north-east half-way up a range of hills, the country about very barren.&nbsp;
Indeed the aspect of the country is much like that between Hussun Abdul
and the Jhilun, except in the rarity of <i>Phulahi</i>.</p>
<p>A great affinity exists in foliation between Terebinthace and Sapindace&aelig;.&nbsp;
Also both in foliation, flowers, and habit, between Myrtace&aelig; and
Guttifer&aelig;, the only material differences being in aroma, and adherent
ovary.</p>
<p>The plants observed about Nalighur Bungalow, exclusive of species
collected, were Cassia lanceolatoid, this is the common Indian <i>Tora</i>,
Acacia, <i>Rairoo</i>, Achyranthes aspera, Digera arvensis, Polanisia
viscosa, Carissa, Carandas, Bheir frutex, Coccinea communis, Cucurbita,
Sida multilocularis, Amaranthus? spicatus, Cassia fistula.</p>
<p>Eleusine <i>echinata</i>; Poa very common, as well as <i>Dhoob</i>.</p>
<p>In gardens&mdash;Tabernamontana coronaria, <i>Bhee</i>, Chrysanthemum
double and ligulate.&nbsp; Of Birds, <i>Pica</i> <i>vagans</i>.</p>
<p><i>28th</i>.&mdash;From Nalighur to Ramgurh, a good ten miles.&nbsp;
The road first ascends through and above the town, then follows a short
twisting descent, and soon after a very long but not very steep ascent,
until it comes over the ravine of the Ramgurh river, and the descent
to that torrent; thence an uninterrupted steep ascent about as much
as the descent to Ramgurh.&nbsp; There is no bungalow at this stage,
merely a few shops and sheds.&nbsp; The fort is situated to the left
of and 600 feet above the town.</p>
<p>From Ramgurh to Sahee Bungalow, the distance is eight miles, there
is a steep descent to Sursa torrent, which contains very little water,
then a rather long and gradual ascent, then descend to the Gumbur river.&nbsp;
The road then extends up this ascent for one and a half mile, and continues
ascending on the right bank until within half a mile of the bungalow,
to which there is a slight descent.&nbsp; There is no made road along
the Gumbur, and I missed or did not observe the Soorog river.&nbsp;
The Gumbur is a clear, good-sized stream, fordable about the rapids,
bed narrow confined.</p>
<p>The hills traversed were comparatively barren, and decidedly uninteresting.&nbsp;
However much in appearance they may here and there assimilate to the
Khorassan hills, no identity in vegetation exists except perhaps in
the Apocynum found at Attock.</p>
<p>The country is cultivated with great labour, and the villages though
small are numerous, and present a look of plenty, like English white-washed
cottages.</p>
<p>There is a difference between the vegetation of the hills near the
plains and those in the interior.&nbsp; On the former there are scarcely
any trees, and Adhatoda occurs in greater profusion than elsewhere.&nbsp;
The Himalayan provinces here present an extreme affinity with the same
range to the eastward, as Bootan and Mussoorie, but the forms are by
no means so frequent&mdash;i.e. species are not so numerous.&nbsp; Throughout
the above twenty-eight miles the vegetation is tropical: a few European
forms occur as one gets into the hills, but they are of no great value.&nbsp;
The chief arboreous vegetation consists of Rubiace&aelig;, Mimose&aelig;,
Cassiace&aelig; (<i>Bauhinia</i>), Bignoniace&aelig;, and Myrtace&aelig;.&nbsp;
These are much the most common between Ramgurh and the ridge over Naligurh.&nbsp;
Here also Nyctanthes is very common; Zanthoxylon also occurs here and
there like an Ash.</p>
<p>On the ridge above Ramgurh, Adhatoda is very common; Carandas likewise
occurs, but is not very common; Eranthemoides is rather common, but
this occurs in profusion on the descent; Cassia tora, O. lanceolata,
and Peristrophe occur.</p>
<p>On the descent from the above ridge, Porana appears.&nbsp; Lemon-grass,
Bambusifolia, Cryptogram&aelig; calamelanos, Adiantum flagelliformis.</p>
<p>On the long ascent Grislea, Acacia, Bheir, Zanthoxylon, Cordia, Nyctanthes,
Myrtace&aelig; 1-2, Wendlandia, Bignonia, Randia, and two or three other
trees about houses, a species of Ficus; Euphorbia antiquorum common
on the drier parts.</p>
<p>On the ascent from the torrent, the vegetation is thick.&nbsp; Bauhinia
scandens, Carandas, Butea, Erythrina, neither common, others as before:
Loranthus.</p>
<p>At Ramgurh, Peepul, Erythrina, Rhus planted; Euphorbia antiquorum
very common, Cassia tora, C. lanceolata, Carandas common, Kalanch&oelig;
integrifolia, Adhatoda not rare, scarcely a single wild tree.</p>
<p>Scutellaria occurs on the descent.&nbsp; Rubus, Berberis, Gnaphalium.&nbsp;
On the ascent from Sursa, Geranium, Clematis, Asparagus, Trichodesma
of the plains, Bombax (young), Bambusa, Hir&oelig;a, Dioscorea, Fragaria,
Adiantum flagelliformis, Calomelanos, Saccharum, <i>Moong</i>, Acacia,
Adhatoda, Vitex, etc. as before, but trees are not common, except Ficus
and <i>Bheir</i> in profusion.</p>
<p>Descent to the Gumbur the same.&nbsp; Pyrus pomum appears, Carandas,
Anatherum muricatum, Briedleioides common.&nbsp; Along the Gumbur river,
Pyrus, Adhatoda, Mimosa, Dalbergia sissoo, Myrtace&aelig;, Euphorbia,
etc. continue as before.</p>
<p>Between Nalighur and the commencement of the descent to the Gumbur,
and especially between the Sursa and that descent, the chief vegetation
is tropical grasses, such as Andropogons.&nbsp; Along the Gumbur, the
hills are well covered with tall bushes.&nbsp; Carandas common, but
little if any grass.</p>
<p>Fossil shells are found along the Gumbur.&nbsp; Of birds Pica vagans,
H&aelig;matornis, and several Sylvi&aelig; were observed.</p>
<p>About Sahi, young Pinus longifolia; all around, the hills are of
the same aspect.&nbsp; No fish were seen in the Gumbur, although I crossed
it several times.&nbsp; The view of the plains shows the commencement
of the great chain stretching out in low, very much undulated hillocks,
precisely as in Khorassan.</p>
<p><i>29th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded from Syree to Konyar: this I think the
longest of the marches to Loodianah, and is nothing but one series of
ascents and descents chiefly along the Gumbur ravine: at the foot of
ascent to the Konyar, the road crosses a considerable stream, and nearly
at the summit of the ascent, branches off to Soobathoo.</p>
<p>Konyar is a rather large village, well ornamented with trees, in
rather a fine sort of valley, every inch of which is cultivated.&nbsp;
The tank adjacent to the village is well stocked with Nelumbium.</p>
<p>To Syree, the distance is eight and a half to nine miles.&nbsp; The
road crosses the Konyar village and valley, then ascends to the south-east,
and continues ascending gradually by an excellent road for a considerable
way, then it skirts a ridge and comes on the grand Soobathoo road.&nbsp;
From this a short but steep ascent, followed by a descent of a mile
and a quarter, conducts you to the bungalow.</p>
<p>No change occurs in the vegetation.&nbsp; The hills are more grassy
and more bare of trees, especially near Syree, but this is partly owing
to cultivation.&nbsp; The principal woody feature is Euphorbia antiquorum.</p>
<p>The plants before noticed occur throughout, except about Syree, where
scarcely a shrub is to be seen, nothing but burnt up grasses.</p>
<p>At Sahi, Roylea appears, also an odd-looking Modeeca and a Deeringia.&nbsp;
Near these is also an Asplenium, Echites.&nbsp; At Konyar, Prinsepia
appears, and continues becoming more and more frequent up to Syree.&nbsp;
Towards this place V. reniformis is seen, not a single northern grass,
although Syree must be nearly 5,000 feet high.</p>
<p>At Sahi, Pinus longifolia, Ph&oelig;nix, Salix, and Polygonum of
Chugur-Serai; this is common as far as Konyar.&nbsp; Acacia, Carandas,
Urtica nivea.&nbsp; Rice cultivated.</p>
<p>About three miles beyond it, there is a beautiful ravine with dense
jungle and fine trees, chiefly Laurinea, and I think a Rhus; this is
the only spot I have seen reminding me of the Himalaya to the eastward.</p>
<p>At Konyar&mdash;Toon, Morus, Musa, Deeringia, Berberis, Briedleia.</p>
<p>The hills are as usual marked with wavy parallel lines, on which
nothing appears to grow.&nbsp; These lines are united by smaller oblique
ones, whence their origin?</p>
<p><i>30th</i>.&mdash;To Simla.&nbsp; The road extends over undulated
ground along ridges until the foot of the great ascent is reached; this
is long and steep, especially steep at the first, or Buttiara pass,
where it turns to the face of the mountain, and extends through beautiful
woods.&nbsp; The ground frozen, with some snow; from this to Simla the
road is tolerably level, and defended on the <i>Khudd</i>, or precipice
side by a railing.&nbsp; It then passes through fir woods, etc. in which
the exceedingly pretty Jay of Bharowli is common.</p>
<p>The vegetation to the foot of the ascent, and nearly half-way up,
is unchanged.&nbsp; Andropogoneous grasses forming the prevailing feature;
but little arboreus or shrubby vegetation occurs.&nbsp; About halfway
between Syree and this an ascent takes place, on which Daphne, Hypericum,
and Echinops occur.</p>
<p>Near Syree&mdash;Bombax, Ruta albiflora, Daphne, Pteris aquilina,
Clutia, Aspidium, Polytrichum nanum and aloides, Hypericum, Berberis,
Rubus, Prinsepia, Rosa, Jubrung, Grislea, (rare,) Clematis, Cerasus,
<i>Datura</i>, <i>Bukhein</i>, Citrus, Spermacoce, P&oelig;deria azurea,
and Andropogon bambusifolia were observed.&nbsp; Ficus two species,
Ficus repens, Pommereullioid spicis longis, Rubia Mungista, Galium,
Polygonum of Chugur, Carissa, (rare,) Amaranthace&aelig;, Conyza.</p>
<p>The great ascent is very instructive; half-way up observed Gaultheria,
conspicuous from its blood-coloured leaves; an oak occurs commonly but
stunted, and a few stunted Pinus longifolia.</p>
<p>Buddl&aelig;oides occurs two-thirds of the way up, with Mespilus
microphyllus, Alpina, Labiata and Pyrus.</p>
<p>The oaks and Gaultheria increase in number and size towards Bithuria,
Conaria.</p>
<p>The first to cease is Euphorbia.</p>
<p>At the summit Berberis, Polygonum of Chugur, Rubus deltoideus, Conyza
and Prinsepia may be found, but to no extent.&nbsp; From this to Simla
the vegetation is chiefly northern.</p>
<p>Nothing definite is observable with regard to the distribution of
forests about Simla.&nbsp; The principal secondary ranges, including
the Choor, which is quite void of shrubby vegetation, is about north-east
and south-west; generally the southern aspects of those ridges on which
forests occur is bare; of this, there is a notable instance&mdash;Muhassoo.</p>
<p>Mount Jacka, which looks east and west by its broad faces, has both
densely enough wooded with oak, Euonymus, Rhododendron, Gaultheria,
and Ilex, but the ridge which looks to the plains is bare.</p>
<p>Some ridges again are quite bare, as that lowish one between Mounts
Jacka and Muhassoo.</p>
<p>The thickest and most humid woods decidedly occur on the northern
faces of the ridges; and all about Simla instances of this occur.&nbsp;
Such spots are at Simla so much sheltered from the sun, that the snow
which fell on the 23rd November is scarcely diminished.</p>
<p>Even in these there is no comparison in luxuriance and variety of
vegetation with the Mishmee or Bootan portions of the same stupendous
chain.</p>
<p>The trees are few in number as regards species, the only ones I have
observed are a species of oak which is very common, forming the chief
vegetation of the northern faces, and of both those of Mount Jacka.</p>
<p>The scarlet Rhododendron which occurs in the highest parts of the
woods, an occasional Pyrus, Benthamia, Euonymus, Gaultheria very common,
also Pinus Deodara, longifolia, and excelsa; of these the Deodar is
most common.&nbsp; Ilex, a pretty tree, occurring on Mount Jacka.</p>
<p>The following forms also I have noticed&mdash;Saxifraga ciliata,
Berberis asiatica, and Gnaphalia three or four species, which are chiefly
confined to grassy naked ridges.&nbsp; Thymus is also confined to these.</p>
<p>Ruta albiflora is very common in woods; Dipsacea and Artemisia on
exposed grassy spots; Swertia is common in damp places; Spir&aelig;a
bella, Ledum, Stemodia, Epilobium, Viola, Saccharum rubrum, Valeriana,
Fragaria, Galium, Clematis, Rosa, Rubus, Rumex, Leguminos&aelig;, Coronilloid,
Smilax.</p>
<p>Acanthace&aelig;, Androsace&aelig;, particularly a Gnaphalioides
common on the exposed ridge of Mount Jacka; Myrsinea frutex, Parnassia
common, Salix fruticosa; on Prospect Point, Lycopodium, Herminioid,
Epipactis, Orchide&aelig; ali&aelig;, 2 Scitamine&aelig;.</p>
<p>El&aelig;agnus, Mespilus microphyllus, Polygonum of Chugur; 2 or
3 Amaranthace&aelig;; Prinsepia, rare; very little variety in ferns;
Pteris chrysocarpa, Aspidium pungens, and another are the most common;
nor is there any variety in Epiphytous ferns, and very few Jungermannias.&nbsp;
The Mosses are Bartramia, Catharinea, Polytrichum aloides on banks with
Fissidens, otherwise Hypna are the most prevalent.&nbsp; A Neckera hangs
from every tree, and a Pterogonio Neckeroid covers almost every trunk,
a Brachymenium is likewise common.</p>
<p>Altogether, though numerous, there is no great variety in form.</p>
<p>On the summit of Chaka, Quercus, Gaultheria, and Rhododendron are
common; with here and there a Deodar.</p>
<p>On the east face of that mountain consisting of a long ridge, grasses
form the chief vegetation, among which Andropogons and Sch&oelig;nanthus
are not uncommon, Gnaphalia and Artemisia occur; Thymus, Androsace gnaphalioides,
Potentilla, Coronilloid, Labiata frutex, Jasminum, Rosa, Mespilus microphyllus,
Clematis, Cnicus, Rubus, Labiata alia, Galium, Swertia, Salvia were
noticed.</p>
<p>Of the tropical forms, Andropogoneous grasses are most common, Saccharum
rubrum of the Khasyah Mountains, Desmodium, Acanthace&aelig;, and El&aelig;agnus,
which last occurs on Prospect Point.</p>
<p>Saccharum rubrum extends up to 8,000 feet.</p>
<p>The woods generally on the surface are matted down with grasses or
Carexes, so that there is no variety of surface for the lower orders;
in such places, Ophiopogon is very common.</p>
<p>Regarding the Conifer&aelig;, Pinus excelsa is the rarest, Deodar
is the most common; longifolia occurs principally on a southern projection
from Chaka, and on the south face of the Mall ridge.</p>
<p><i>December</i> <i>5th</i>, <i>1840</i>.&mdash;Went to Mount Fagoo.&nbsp;
After passing Mount Jacka, or Chaka, you come on a bare country which
continues at least on all the southern aspects until you reach the ascent
to Muhassoo, which is at first steep, then gradual and long; the vegetation
remains unchanged until the Muhassoo ascent is begun upon; then Rhododendron,
Quercus and Gaultheria soon cease, and their places are occupied by
a Quercus much like Q. semecarpifolius, Pinus excelsa also occurs rather
abundantly, and of good size, the other vegetation continues.</p>
<p>The first part of Muhassoo, along which the road runs for some hundred
yards under its crest, is occupied by grassy vegetation, chiefly Andropogon
and Sch&oelig;nanthus; Gnaphalia, Buddl&aelig;a, Labiata, Polygonum
of Chugur, Thymus, etc., and the crest of the same is chiefly occupied
by the undescribed oak.</p>
<p>But where the ridge takes a north and south direction, the west face
becomes almost exclusively occupied by Deodars, among which as one proceeds
up, Pinus Smithiana occurs; after turning again close to the little
Bazar on the north face, the road continues on this side to Fagoo, extending
through a heavy and magnificent forest of Pinus Smithiana and Quercus
semecarpifolius, the Deodar almost ceasing to appear; occasional knolls
are passed, on which grasses, Gnaphalium, etc. occur, the scenery is
very beautiful, the trees being ornamented with the grey pendulous lichen,
and with Necker&aelig;, particularly the dark Neckera pendula.&nbsp;
The underwood consists here and there of shrubs, but generally herbaceous
vegetation, as grasses, Gnaphalia, etc.</p>
<p>In fact Muhassoo is genuinely Himalayan.</p>
<p>From Fagoo eastward the country is bare, except at great elevations;
near Muttiara to the north, forest-clad mountains occur, also at Huttoo,
and far away to the eastward other fir-clad ridges appear.</p>
<p>It may be said that the really fine forests are restricted above,
within 8,000 feet.</p>
<p>The Smithia pine is a really fine tree, often 100 feet high, and
three to five feet in diameter, known by its downward curved branches,
pendulous branchlets, and pendulous oblong cones: many dead trees from
the effects of barking were observed.&nbsp; It is worthy of remark,
that potatoes are now cultivated in these woods.</p>
<p>The Deodar is not so large as Smithia, and is known by its tabular
branches and ovoid erect cones.</p>
<p>Andropogoneous grasses occur high up; even at the summit Acanthace&aelig;
occur, scarcely any change in the terrestrial ferns, among which Adiantum
is found in profusion along the road, little change in Mosses, a Polytrichum
occurs at the higher elevations, also a Dicranum on dead trunks of trees.</p>
<p>The only new arboreous vegetation consists in an Acer, which is a
small tree, also a small Poplar and Quercus semecarpifolius, this varies
greatly, Pinus Smithiana, Limonia laureola, a shrubby Rhododendron.</p>
<p>Fagoo is only 5,600 feet above the adjacent heights.</p>
<p>On the edge of the forest, the following genera, etc. were noticed&mdash;Spir&aelig;a
bella and S. aruncus,* Berberis asiatica, Swertia, grasses common, Gnaphalium,
Senecio., Epilobium, Pteris chysocarpa, P. aquilina, Adiantum, Aspidium,
Rumex, the Labiata fruticosa of Jacka, Potentilla sanguinea, Artemisia,
Coronilloid, Androsacea, Gnaphalioid, Epipactis, Carex, Cnicus, Viola,
Valerianum, Jasminum,* Viburnum,* V. aliud, Populus,* Silene, Mespilus
microphyllus, Verbascum, Thapsia, Ilex, Euonymus, Loniceroid, Acer,*
Eriogonoid,* Geranium scandens.*</p>
<p>Bupleuroid, Polytrichum, Rosa, Rubus, Salex fruticosa,* Fragaria,
Crat&aelig;gus,* Saxifraga crassifolia, Viscum, Rubia cordifolia.</p>
<p>* Means altitudinal.</p>
<p>Viscum has one attachment, but from this many branches spring after
the form of the primary one.&nbsp; Muhassoo is of great extent, because
an arm of the mountain extends to the south, and there assumes a considerable
height, equal to that of Muhassoo itself, and equally well wooded.&nbsp;
It is of all other situations about Simla the proper place for collecting.&nbsp;
The succession of the pines in these regions is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>P. longifolia, dry barren spots, from 5,000 to 7,500 feet, as Rhododendrum
arboreum.</p>
<p>P. excelsa, from 7,500 to 8,500 feet, no groups occur.</p>
<p>P. Deodars, from 7,500 to 9,000 feet, especially on southern faces.</p>
<p>P. Smithiana, from 9,000 to 10,000 feet, and is in the highest perfection
on north faces.</p>
<p>One thing remarkable is the wide ranges of the above forms, for excepting
those marked with an asterisk, all are found about Simla.</p>
<p>The most common herbaceous family on Muhassoo is Composit&aelig;,
and very strange to say, most of its forms, as indeed the others, excepting
some of the trees, are found on the Khasyah Mountains at much lower
elevations, and much lower latitudes.&nbsp; Of birds the <i>Cone</i>-<i>eater</i>
of Bootan occurs.</p>
<p><i>7th</i>.&mdash;To Annandale, a pretty level spot, some 2,000 feet
below Simla, remarkable for its beautiful grove of Deodars.</p>
<p>Of the wild grasses they are almost all exclusively tropical forms,
Paniceous or Andropogoneous.&nbsp; The chief cultivation of the hills,
Atriplex sanguinea, <i>bhatoo</i> <i>vena</i>, some fine walnut trees,
mulberries, also Celtoidea? <i>Kirrack</i> <i>ven</i>, Zanthoxylon.</p>
<p>Passed a herd of red-rumped monkeys; the crooked-tailed <i>Lungoor</i>
is also found here.</p>
<p>Rich vegetation extends down the southern slope, where there is a
waterfall.&nbsp; It is curious that both here and in Annandale the Deodar
grows to a large size, although naturally its range does not extend
so low as this slope.&nbsp; Passed a beautiful temple, surrounded with
fine Deodars.</p>
<p>Ferns occur in more abundance, thence downwards Woodwardia, Dicksonia?
Cyatheoides, and Adiantum.&nbsp; Mosses also occur on the dripping rocks.</p>
<p>An Alnus also occurs.</p>
<p>No fish were visible in the streamlet.&nbsp; Peristrophe occurs throughout
from Roopur to Simla.</p>
<p>Epiphytous or at least <i>Epirupous</i> Scitaminia.&nbsp; Hedychium
is found on rocks on this slope, which would give an elevation of about
5,500 feet.</p>
<p>On the sunny sides of hills about Simla, Dicerma is found, this is
one of the most tropical forms.</p>
<p>No Epiphytous Orchidea are seen.&nbsp; And of birds Enicurus, the
redstart of torrents, and Myophonus were observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The subjoined Table contains the latitudes and the altitudes

the Cabul campaign in 1838-40, from his original observations.&nbsp;
The altitudes for the latitudes were taken with the sextant and the

that it may be relied on the latitudes herein given are correct to within
half a minute in space.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
